The only reference to this product with this spelling was in a drink named the Cubano. Its first appearance was in the Savoy Cocktail Book (London 1930). In 1934, "Cocktail Bill" Boothby listed the recipe in his guide with the ingredient entirely eliminated, as did Trader Vic in 1947. Ever since, (as here,) "Charbreux" only shows up in recipe lists which draw from the Savoy book - or from the books which drew from those books!	2020-04-09 22:22:22.083+02

It was a delicate compound it elevated my contentment to an even higher pitch. Unquestionably the cocktail on my tale was a dangerous agent, for it held in its shallow glass bowl slightly encrusted with undissolved sugar the power of a contemptuous indifference to fate; it set the mind free of responsibility; obliterating both memory and tomorrow, it gave the heart an adventitious feeling of superiority and momentarily vanquished all the celebrated, the eternal fears. Yes, that was the danger of skillfully prepared intoxicating drinks... The word 'intoxicating' adequately expressed their power, their menace to orderly, monotonous resignation. A word, I thought further, debased by moralists from its primary ecstatic content... but then, a fresh Daiquiri and a sprig of orange blossom in my button-hole, it meant less than nothing."\r\n\r\nA short extract from Joseph Hergesheimer's "San Cristobal de la Habana," which contains much wisdom concerning Drinks, Cigars and the Art of Fine Living.\r\n\r\n(Quoted by kind permission of the publishers, Messrs. William Heineman Ltd., and Messrs. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.)	2020-04-10 15:19:18.778+02

Wheeler; friend of Wild Westerners, Wild Bill Hickok, Buffalo Bill, Poker Alice Tubbs, Calamity Jane, Madame Mustache and Diamond Dick Turner of Norfolk, Neb.: Clark is buried in Sunrise Mountain, overlooking Deadwood Gulch, S. Dak.</p>\r\n\r\nNote from the book: For 6 people.	2020-04-19 15:41:59.677+02
7	Absinthe Drip		Dissolve 1 lump of Sugar, using the French drip spoon, and fill glass with cold water.\r\n\r\nNote: The French Drip spoon is a perforated spoon.\r\n\r\nHave some ice water ready in a pitcher which you can easily drip water slowly from. Some people use water bottles with those nipple things on them. Other just poke small holes in the bottoms of clean yoghurt containers.\r\n\r\nPour an ounce of Absinthe in a double old-fashioned glass or small water glass. Put your tea strainer or Absinthe spoon on top of your glass. Put a sugar cube in your tea strainer.\r\n\r\nSlowly drip water onto your sugar cube, allowing the water to drip over, and down into the Absinthe.\r\n\r\nAt some time while you are dripping, you will start to see the Absinthe cloud. What is happening is, as the alcohol percentage of the solution drops, less oils are able to stay dissolved and they precipitate out forming what is called a “louche”.\r\n\r\nWhen your Absinthe appears milky, give it a taste. Too strong? Add a few more drops of water.\r\n\r\nThe traditional dilution is 5 parts water to 1 part Absinthe. If you’re using an Absinthe-a-like, which are usually bottled at 80-90 proof instead of Absinthe’s 140, you may not want to use that much water.	2020-04-02 21:15:31.179+02
53	Bacardi Special		Shake well and strain into cocktail glass.\r\n\r\nNote from the book: Made famous by Karl K. Kitchen, the well-known New York Newspaper Columnist.	2020-04-07 22:31:55.004+02
569	Sanctuary		Shake well and strain into cocktail glass.\r\n\r\n<p style="color:red">So-called because the Savoy, together with The Clink, Deadman's Place, Fulwood's Rents, The Mint, Mitre Court, Baldwin's Gardens and Stepney were the last places in London where the privilege of "Sanctuary" existed. Unfortunately this privilege was abolished by "The Escape from Prison Act" in 1697. But even to-day no Ladies are allowed in the Savoy's inner American Cocktail Bar.</p>	2020-04-16 18:08:37.369+02
80	Blue Blazer		Use two large silver-plated mugs, with handles.\r\n\r\n1 Wineglass Scotch Whisky.\r\n1 Wineglass Boiling Water.\r\n\r\nPut the Whisky into one mug, and the boiling water into the other, ignite the Whisky with fire, and while blazing mix, both ingredients by pouring them four or five times from one mug to the other. If well done, this will have the appearance of a continued stream of liquid fire.\r\n\r\n<i>Sweeten with one teaspoonful of powdered white sugar and serve in a small bar tumbler, with a piece of lemon peel.</i>\r\n\r\n<p style="color:blue">The <i>Blue Blazer</i> does not have a very euphonious or classic name, but it tastes better to the palate than it sounds to the ear. A beholder gazing for the first time upon an experienced artist compounding this beverage, would naturally come to the conclusion that it was a nectar for Pluto rather than Bacchus. The novice in mixing this beverage should be careful not to scald himself. To become proficient in throwing the liquid from one mug to the other, it will be necessary to practice for some time with cold water.</p>	2020-04-08 23:12:54.333+02

166	Corn Popper		1 Pint Corn (Georgia or Maryland).\r\n\r\nFill highball glasses half full of this mixture and fill up with Vichy or Seltzer.\r\n\r\nNote: What is "Corn"?\r\n\r\n“Corn” is a shorthand code, especially a post-prohibition work, merely for illicit spirits (often, but not necessarily, whiskey) that may be made from nearly any ingredient except fruit, but including sugar, wheat, rye, “ship stuff,” sorghum, cattle feed, mule chop, and, on occasion, corn.\r\n\r\nJust like “The South” is used as a false badge of authenticity when attributing origins to quite local corn whiskey, “corn” itself is a suspect appellation.\r\n\r\nShake loose that notion that “corn” is ever really corn whiskey. Unfortunate, but there it is. From the 1920’s through the late 1990’s, sugar formed the backbone of American off-the-books distilling. It was cheaper, faster, and more profitable to make sugar spirits than corn. When the price was right, you could call it whatever you want.	2020-04-09 22:02:47.45+02

1	Vermouths	
3	Gins	<p>\r\nGin is a distilled alcoholic drink that derives its predominant flavour from juniper berries (<i>Juniperus communis</i>). Gin is one of the broadest categories of spirits, all of various origins, styles, and flavour profiles, that revolve around juniper as a common ingredient.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFrom its earliest origins in the Middle Ages, the drink has evolved from a herbal medicine to an object of commerce in the spirits industry. Gin emerged in England after the introduction of the jenever, a Dutch and Belgian liquor which originally had been a medicine. Although this development had been taking place since early 17th century, gin became widespread after the William of Orange-led 1688 Glorious Revolution and subsequent import restrictions on French brandy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGin today is produced in subtly different ways, from a wide range of herbal ingredients, giving rise to a number of distinct styles and brands. After juniper, gin tends to be flavoured with botanical/herbal, spice, floral or fruit-flavours or often a combination. It is most commonly consumed mixed with tonic water. Gin is also often used as a base spirit to produce flavoured gin-based liqueurs such as, for example, Sloe gin, traditionally by the addition of fruit, flavourings and sugar. \r\n</p>
7	Chartreuses	Common name for Green and Yellow Chartreuses.
8	Brandies	<p>Brandy is a spirit produced by distilling wine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn a broader sense, the term brandy also denotes liquors obtained from the distillation of pomace (yielding pomace brandy), or mash or wine of any fruit (fruit brandy). These products are also called <i>eau de vie</i> (which translates to "water of life").\r\n</p>
9	Crème de Menthe	Colored and colorless mint-flavoured liqueurs.
10	Whiskies	Whisky or whiskey is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash. Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn, rye, and wheat. Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, generally made of charred white oak.
11	Wines	A fermented juice of grapes.
12	Rums	Aged and non-aged distillate of sugarcane molasses or sugarcane juice.
13	Sherries	All types of fortified vines coming from Jerez region of Spain.
6	Triple Secs	<p>\r\nTriple sec, originally Curaçao triple sec, is a type of strong, sweet and colorless orange-flavored liqueur. It is a variety of Curaçao liqueur, an orange-flavored liqueur made from the dried peels of bitter and sweet oranges.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Sec" is the French word for dry. The etymology of the term "triple sec" is unclear.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTriple sec may be consumed neat as a digestif, or on the rocks. However, it is more typically used as an ingredient in a variety of cocktails, such as sangria, Margarita, Kamikaze, White Lady, Long Island Iced Tea, Sidecar, Skittle Bomb, Corpse Reviver #2 and Cosmopolitan.\r\n</p>
14	Ports	Portuguese fortified wines.
15	Ice creams	Solidified mixture of milk (or water), sugar and -- in most cases -- some flavoring agent.

113	Chartreuse	<p>\r\nChartreuse (US: /ʃɑːrˈtruːz, -ˈtruːs/, UK: /-ˈtrɜːz/, French: [ʃaʁtʁøz]) is a French liqueur available in green and yellow versions that differ in taste and alcohol content. The liqueur has been made by the Carthusian Monks since 1737 according to the instructions set out in a manuscript given to them by François Annibal d'Estrées in 1605. It was named after the monks' Grande Chartreuse monastery, located in the Chartreuse Mountains in the general region of Grenoble in France. The liqueur is produced in their distillery in the nearby town of Voiron (Isère). It is composed of distilled alcohol aged with 130 herbs, plants and flowers. It is one of the handful of liqueurs that continue to age and improve in the bottle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Order of Chartreuse was more than 500 years old when, in 1605, at a Chartreuse monastery in Vauvert, a small suburb of Paris, the monks received a gift from Duc Francois Hannibal d’ Estrées, Marshal of King’s Henri IV artillery : an already ancient manuscript from an “Elixir” soon to be nicknamed “Elixir of Long Life”. This manuscript was probably the work of a 16th century alchemist with a great knowledge of herbs and with the skill to blend, infuse, macerate the 130 of them to form a perfect balanced tonic.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the early 17th century, only a few monks and even fewer apothecaries understood the use of herbs and plants in the treatment of illness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe manuscript’s recipe was so complex that only bits and pieces of it were understood and used at Vauvert.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, the manuscript was sent to the Mother House of the Order – La Grande Chartreuse – in the mountains not far from Grenoble. Here an exhaustive study of the manuscript was undertaken.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Monastery’s Apothecary, Frère Jerome Maubec, finally unravelled the mystery and, in 1737, drew up the practical formula for the preparation of the Elixir in <b>1764</b>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe distribution and sales of this new medicine were limited. One of the monks of La Grande Chartreuse, Frère Charles, would load his mule with the small bottles that he sold in Grenoble and other nearby villages.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nToday, this “Elixir of Long Life” is still made only by the Chartreuse monks following that ancient recipe, and is called Elixir Vegetal de la Grande-Chartreuse.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis “liqueur of health” is all natural plants, herbs and other botanicals suspended in wine alcohol – 69% alcohol by volume, 138 proof.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo tasty was this elixir that it was often used as a beverage rather than a medicine. Recognizing this, the monks, in <b>1840</b>, adapted the elixir recipe to make a milder beverage which we know today as “Green Chartreuse» – 55% alcohol, 110 proof. The success of this liqueur was immediate and its fame was no longer restricted to the area around La Grande Chartreuse.\r\nThe French Revolution erupted in 1789. Members of all Religious Orders were ordered out of the country. The Chartreuse monks left France in 1793. They made a copy of the manuscript kept by one of them who remained in the Monastery.\r\nAnother Monk was in charge of the original. Shortly after leaving the “Grande Chartreuse” he was arrested and sent to prison in Bordeaux.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFortunately, he was not searched and was able to secretly pass the original manuscript to one of his friends Dom Basile Nantas.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDom Basile, convinced the Order would never come back to France and unable to make the Elixir himself, sold the recipe to Monsieur Liotard, a pharmacist in Grenoble.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMr. Liotard never produced the Elixir.In 1810, when the Emperor Napoleon ordered all the “secret” recipes of medicines to be sent to the Ministry of the Interior, Monsieur Liotard duly followed the law and submitted the manuscript. It was returned to him marked “Refused”. Refused as not considered “secret”, already well known.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen Monsieur Liotard died, his heirs returned the manuscript to the Chartreuse Monks who had returned to their Monastery in 1816.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1840, the Chartreuse distillers developed a sweeter form of Chartreuse : “Yellow Chartreuse” (40% alcohol, 80 proof).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Fourvoirie distillery,destroyed by a landslide in 1935\r\nIn 1903, the French government nationalized the Chartreuse distillery. The monks were expelled. The distillers went to Spain where they built a new distillery in Tarragona. And, from 1921 to 1929, an additional one in Marseille (France).\r\nThe liqueur from Tarragona was nicknamed “Une Tarragone”.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe one from Marseille was then officially called “Tarragone”.\r\nEarly in the years following the nationalization of the distillery and of the Monastery, the French government sold the trademark “Chartreuse” to a group of distillers who set up the “Compagnie Fermière de la Grande Chartreuse”.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was in existence until 1929, the year when it went bankrupt. The shares were bought by friends of the Monks and offered to them. Thus, the Monks regained ownership of the Chartreuse trademark.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThey returned to their distillery, which had been built in 1860 at Fourvoirie, not far from the Monastery, and resumed production of the true Chartreuse liqueurs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1935, Fourvoirie was almost totally destroyed by a landslide; manufacturing was transferred to Voiron where it is today.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe selection, crushing and mixing of the secret herbs, plants and other botanicals used in producing the liqueurs is done in the monastery by two monks.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOnce mixed the ingredients are taken to Voiron were they are first left to macerate in carefully selected alcohol, then distilled.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, these liqueurs are aged for several years in huge oak casks and placed into the world’s longest liqueur cellar for maturation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA small portion of the liqueur is selected for special treatment. This bit of liqueur is aged for an extra length of time and, after the chief distiller declares it ready for bottling, it is packaged and marketed as V.E.P. Chartreuse (“Viellissement Exceptionnellement Prolongé”). Each bottle of V.E.P. – a reproduction of the one used in 1840 – is individually numbered, sealed with wax and presented in its own carefully-fitted wooden boxSince 1970, a company named “Chartreuse Diffusion” is in charge of bottling, packaging, advertising and selling the products still prepared by two Carthusian Brothers entrusted with this mission by their Order. They work in the greatest secrecy and are the only ones who know the details of manufacturing.

17	Kina Lillet	Sources: <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/spirits/aperitif/best-kina-lillet-substitutes">1</a>, <a href="https://summerfruitcup.wordpress.com/tag/kina-lillet-substitute/">2</a>.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIan Fleming's classic Bondian cocktail, the Vesper, hinges on one, now extinct ingredient: Kina Lillet. Created at the end of the 19th century in France, Kina Lillet was one of the first spirits in the class of quinquinas, wine-based spirits flavored with bitter quinine extracted from cinchona bark. Although the Kina Lillet disappeared sometime in the late 1960s, other Lillet bottlings such as Blanc and Dry retained quinine as an ingredient, making them serviceable replacements for Kina. But then, in 1986, Lillet began production without the all important bittering agent. The aperitifs were saccharine, syrupy, and one-dimensional. As a result, the Vesper suffered and became a shadow of its former self.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLuckily, a newfound appreciation of bitter flavors amongst drinkers and bartenders alike has inspired importers to bring a slew of new quinquinas into the U.S. market, paving the way for a Vesper revival. Now, the classic cocktail can not only be made as it was originally intended, but it has the capability to reach new levels of bitter glory. Here, five of our favorite substitutions for Kina Lillet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lillet Blanc and Angostura Bitters</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCompared to the original recipe, modern day Lillet Blanc is less bitter, sweeter and more syrupy. For a simple fix, embolden your Lillet Blanc-based Vesper with a few hefty dashes of Angostura bitters. The final cocktail might not look as clear and pristine as it should, but the taste will be superb.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cocchi Americano</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA substitute for the Lillet, this is a wine aperitif with a bitter kick and was recommended to me by Jay Hepburn of the <i>Oh Gosh</i> blog; once again, a trip to an obscure supplier was in order, but it was well worth a visit.  This is a tasty product in its own right and although it makes a good tasting Vesper, I couldn’t shake the feeling that, as the drink contained no Lillet, it wasn’t really a true Vesper.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lillet Blanc and Quinine Bark</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA third alternative would be to add a little quinine powder or bark, either directly to the drink, or using it to create a Lillet infusion. I have now sourced some Cinchona Bark and have experimented a little with some success. I think getting the timing right for the infusion is  a bit tricky and also working out how best to sweeten the Lillet will take a bit to work out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lillet Blanc and China Martini</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOn inspection, I discovered that it is a product made by Martini Rossi, heavily flavoured with Cinchoma Bark – how promising!  After testing various combinations, I found that a 50/50 mix of this and Lillet Blanc worked best, adding the level of bitterness that I sought, as well as the important pale golden colour described in the book. This seemed to be the closest I have come so far.\r\n</p>	17
19	Angostura Bitters	<p>\r\nAngostura bitters (English: /æŋɡəˈstjʊərə/) is a concentrated bitters (herbal alcoholic preparation) based on gentian, herbs and spices, by House of Angostura in Trinidad and Tobago. It is typically used for flavouring beverages or, less often, food. The bitters were first produced in the town of Angostura (now Ciudad Bolívar, Venezuela), hence the name, but do not contain angostura bark. The bottle is recognisable by its distinctive oversized label. 'Angostura' is Spanish for 'narrowing', the town of Angostura having been located at the first narrowing of the Orinoco River. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nThe recipe was developed as a tonic by Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert. A German surgeon general in Simón Bolívar's army in Venezuela. Siegert began to sell it in 1824 and established a distillery for the purpose in 1830. Siegert was based in the town of Angostura and used locally available ingredients, perhaps aided by botanical knowledge of the local Amerindians. The product was sold abroad from 1853, and in 1875 the plant was moved from Ciudad Bolivar to Port of Spain, Trinidad, where it remains. Angostura won a medal at the Weltausstellung 1873 Wien. The medal is still depicted on the oversized label, along with reverse which shows Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria in profile.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe exact formula is a closely guarded secret, with only one person knowing the whole recipe, passed hereditarily.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSince 2007, Angostura has also produced Angostura Orange, an orange bitters with bright floral notes and fresh orange peel. Angostura orange bitters have not dominated the orange bitters market in the same way that its aromatic bitters have become a go-to product for bars and consumers.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009 there was a shortage of Angostura bitters; the company reported that this was caused primarily by a problem in their supply of bottles. There were incorrect rumours of a product recall, or that production of the bitters had stopped at the plant in Trinidad. The shortage was the subject of many news articles and blogs, particularly in the cocktail industry.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>In cocktails</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nAngostura bitters are a key ingredient in many cocktails. Originally used to help with upset stomachs of the soldiers in Simón Bolívar's army, it later became popular in soda water and was usually served with gin. The mix stuck in the form of a pink gin, and is also used in many other alcoholic cocktails such as long vodka, consisting of vodka, bitters, and lemonade. In the United States, it is best known for its use in whiskey cocktails: Old Fashioned, made with whiskey, bitters, sugar, and water, and Manhattan, made usually with rye whiskey and red vermouth. In a Pisco Sour a few drops are sprinkled on top of the foam, both for aroma and decoration. In a Champagne Cocktail a few drops of bitters are added to a sugar cube.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn Hong Kong, Angostura bitters are included in the local Gunner cocktail. Though not in the classic recipe, bartenders sometimes add more flavour to the Mojito cocktail by sprinkling a few drops of Angostura bitters on top. Bitters can also be used in "soft" drinks; a common drink served in Australian and New Zealand pubs is lemon, lime and bitters. In Malawi, bitters are added to a mix of crushed ice, ginger ale and Sprite to make a 'rock shandy'.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAngostura Bitters Drink Guide, a promotional booklet of 1908, was reprinted in 2008 with a new introduction by Ross Bolton.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAmong certain bartending communities (especially in Malaysia) shots of Angostura are taken as the 'bartender's handshake' either during or after the shift is done.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe largest purveyor of Angostura bitters in the world is Nelsen's Hall Bitters Pub on Washington Island off the northeast tip of Door Peninsula in Door County, Wisconsin. The pub began selling shots of bitters as a stomach tonic for medicinal purposes under a pharmaceutical license during Prohibition in the United States. The practice, which helped the pub to become the oldest continuously-operating tavern in Wisconsin, remained a tradition after the repeal of Prohibition. As of 2018, the pub hosts a Bitters Club, incorporates bitters into food menu items, and sells upwards of 10,000 shots per year.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angostura_bitters">[1]</a>.	44.7
47	Maraschino	Maraschino (/ˌmærəˈskiːnoʊ/ marr-ə-SKEE-noh) is a liqueur obtained from the distillation of Marasca cherries. The small, slightly sour fruit of the Tapiwa cherry tree (<i>Prunus cerasus</i> var. <i>marasca</i>), which grows wild along parts of the Dalmatian coast, lends the liqueur its unique aroma.\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1759, Francesco Drioli, a Venetian merchant, began industrial-scale production of maraschino in Zadar, Croatia, which was then part of the Republic of Venice. Drioli displayed that Venetian entrepreneurial spirit that had transformed the popular tradition of home distillation of grappa in the Veneto into a refined and renowned industry, following clear and distinct rules and restrictions, as set down by the Arte dell'acqua di vita.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFrancesco Drioli developed and perfected Giuseppe Carceniga's earlier innovative techniques for the distillation of Marasca cherries and in 1759 he founded the Fabbrica di Maraschino Francesco Drioli (Francesco Drioli Maraschino Factory). By the end of the 18th century his maraschino had already gained widespread fame and had cornered the major markets in Europe, especially in England. In the first advertisement in the London Morning Post and Daily Advertiser, dated 17 June 1779, the firm Johnson and Justerini informed "the nobility and gentry" of having "just imported a large quantity of maraschino from Zara ... of the most exquisite flavour" and in 1804 the Austrian Emperor granted the factory the title <i>Imperial Regia Privilegiata</i> entitling it to use the Imperial coat of arms. The liqueur was sought after by distinguished personages, rulers and courts from all over Europe and the Francesco Drioli factory held Royal Warrants, entitling them to use the royal coat of arms, from the royal households of Austria, Great Britain and Italy. British warships were sent from bases in Corfù and Malta to pick up shipments of maraschino for British royalty. In fact in 1877 the Duke of York (the future George V) and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the factory and accepted "with great pleasure a choice buffet" in the Salghetti-Drioli family home and purchased "more cases of rosolio and several jars of maraschino cherries" (Il Dalmata, a. XXII, no.77, 28 September 1877). From the outset, however, Drioli Maraschino was subject to counterfeiting, a scourge which would plague the factory even after it closed in 1980, forcing its owners to take repeated legal action. In his Via Facti, Nicolò Tommaseo noted how widespread Drioli Maraschino was <i>in Italia... e in tutte cinque le parti del mondo</i> (in Italy... and in all five parts of the world) and he wrote, "<i>in tutte bevuto e in tutte falsificato...</i>" (it is drunk everywhere and faked/copied everywhere).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe square greenish bottles were supplied by Murano glass factories and in the early 19th century the straw cover (known as a "fiasco") was introduced. This was a typical Venetian method for transporting bottles on long sea voyages and would come to define the brand over the years. Following the restoration of Italian sovereignty in the Veneto, Giuseppe's son Francesco Salghetti-Drioli was instrumental in founding a glass factory in Zara, bringing skilled workers from Murano and becoming its first president.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs the reputation of Maraschino grew, so did the name of Zara, which prompted other factories to emerge and become established, particularly those of Girolamo Luxardo (1821) and Romano Vlahov (1861). Together they formed <i>l' industria del maraschino di Zara</i> (the maraschino industry of Zara) of which the acknowledged founder is Francesco Drioli.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Second World War, the persecution of the Tito partisans against the Italian community (some of the Luxardo family, including Pietro and Nicolò Luxardo, were killed by partisans), the bombing of Zara and its transition to Yugoslav sovereignty, marked the end of an era. In the immediate post-war period the owners of the three most important distilleries, Vittorio Salghetti-Drioli, Giorgio Luxardo and Romano Vlahov, sought refuge in Italy and rebuilt their businesses in Mira, near Venice, Torreglia near Padua and Bologna respectively. By 1946 Vittorio had already resumed production and soon recaptured the company's traditional markets worldwide, in particular the English and English-speaking areas. He expertly reconciled his factory's long-standing and prestigious tradition with the demands for modernisation which such a radically altered post-war period called for. The death of Vittorio Salghetti-Drioli, sixth and last heir of the Dalmatian branch of the historic founding family of the maraschino industry of Zara, not only saw the extinction of this branch of the family, but also the end of the two-hundred year history of the Francesco Drioli factory, the oldest Italian liqueur company. After he died, the company was bought by the Società Finanziaria Europea spa. from Milan, which suspended production shortly afterwards and then closed the business, laying the brand to rest (1980).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe valuable Salghetti-Drioli archive, which dates from the second half of the 18th century up to 1943, stands as testimony to the history of the maraschino of Zara. The section preserved by the family in Vicenza was designated of "great historical interest" by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage in 1991, and has been catalogued by Prof. Georgetta Bonfiglio-Dosio. The section remaining in Zara, which was confiscated after the war and the transition of Zara to Yugoslavia, is preserved in the State Archives in Zara (Drzavni Arhiv u Zadru) in the Tvornica F. Drioli Fund, and has been catalogued by the archivist Marijan Maroja. The archive as a whole not only documents the history of the factory, its development over seven generations of entrepreneurs and their considerable contribution to the history of Zara, but lends an insight into historical events that shook the area around the Adriatic. The archive provides an unprecedented resource for historians and archivists from the fall of the Venetian Republic in 1797 up until the transition of Zara to Yugoslav sovereignty in 1947, covering the various periods of Austrian, French and Italian domination. The maraschino industry had played a major role in the history of the city of Zara and in the aftermath of the war, production activities were resumed. Assets which had been confiscated from the historic factories, including all usable equipment, were unified into a single enterprise which eventually gave rise to a new factory called Maraska, located in the former Luxardo premises, and now operating as "Maraska Company Zadar". This company has continued the traditional business, widening its range of liqueurs and syrups to become the most important liqueur producer in Croatia.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Recipe</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen Luxardo marasca cherries are harvested at the beginning of every summer, they are put in alcoholic infusion in larch-wood vats together with some leaves and branches of the same trees for up to three years. When ready, both the liquid and the solid parts are distilled in traditional copper pot stills, separating the heart from heads and tails. Only the heart of the distillate is then allowed to mature in ash-wood vats. The last process consists in transforming the distillate in liqueur by adding a simple syrup of water and sugar lowering the ABV to 32%. Crystal clear in colour, the aroma is typical of marasca cherry distillate with strong alcohol spirit and roasted nuttiness, while the taste results smooth but sharp at the same time with hints of dark chocolate, vanilla and orange marmalade. The tall green bottle with its red cap is still hand-plaited in straw within the company, and resembles the Maraschino bottles produced in Zara in the early days, where the straw was placed in order to prevent damage during transportation. Luxardo Maraschino Originale can be enjoyed in many classic cocktails or neat as an after dinner drink. It is also ideal over fruits such as strawberries, pineapples, oranges etc. or as a flavor in confectionary and ice creams.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSources: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maraschino">[1]</a>, <a href="https://www.luxardo.it/liqueurs-and-distillates/maraschino-originale/">[2]</a>.\r\n</p>	32

43	Curaçao	<p>\r\nCuraçao (/ˈkjʊərəsaʊ, -soʊ/ KEWR-əss-ow, -⁠oh, Dutch: [kyraːˈsʌu]) is a liqueur flavored with the dried peel of the bitter orange laraha, a citrus fruit, grown on the Dutch island of Curaçao.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAn orange-colored version is known as <i>orange Curaçao</i>. The blue one is artificially colored. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCrucual distinction of this spirit from family is that it uses Lahara bitter orange for flavoring; it's pot-distilled (in the opposite to column-distilled Cointreau); and mainly based on sugar cane or brandy spirits.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nCuraçao liqueur is traditionally made with the dried peels of the laraha. Laraha is a bitter orange native to Curaçao with the Latin name <i>Citrus × aurantium subsp. currassuviencis</i>. Spanish explorers brought the bitter Seville orange to the island in 1527, the progenitor of the laraha. Although the bitter flesh of the laraha is unpalatable, the peels are pleasantly aromatic.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is unknown who developed the first Curaçao Liqueur and when. The Dutch West Indies Company took possession of Curaçao in 1634. The Bols distillery, founded in 1575 in Amsterdam, had shares in both the West and East India Companies to guarantee the access to spices required for their distilled drinks.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe company maintains that Lucas Bols (1652–1719) developed a laraha-based liqueur after the discovery that an aromatic oil could be extracted from the unripe peel of the otherwise useless bitter oranges. Bols then had this oil exported back to Amsterdam to produce a liqueur similar to current day Curaçao. Lucas Bols tended to add an "element of alchemical mystery" to his products,[citation needed] explaining the unlikely addition of a blue coloring. In 1912 Bols sold blue curaçao as Crème de Ciel ("cream of the sky"), most likely a reference to the 1907 musical Miss Hook of Holland.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSenior & Co, a company started in Curaçao, is the only company that has always produced its liqueur from the peels of the laraha. The family, Senior and Chumaceiro, started selling their liqueur in 1896 in their pharmacy in small quantities. In 1947 they bought the Landhuis (Dutch for "country manor") Chobolobo in Willemstad, where the distillery has since been housed. As this company is the only one that uses laraha fruit from Curaçao, it includes the word "genuine" on its labels.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Recipe</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nTo create the liqueur the laraha peel is dried, bringing out the sweetly fragranced oils. After soaking in a still with alcohol and water for several days, the peel is removed and other spices are added. The company Senior & Co uses a 120-year-old copper kettle for the distilling process. They put the peels in a gunny bag, spices are added and then hung in a heated copper still with 96% pure and kosher alcohol (derived from sugar cane) for 3 days. After 1 day cooling, water is added and distillation takes place for another 3 days. The liqueur has an orange-like flavor with varying degrees of bitterness. It is naturally colorless but is often given artificial coloring, most commonly blue or orange, which confers an exotic appearance to cocktails and other mixed drinks. The blue color is achieved by adding a food colorant, most often E133 Brilliant Blue.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSome other liqueurs are also sold as Curaçaos with different flavors added, such as coffee, chocolate, and rum and raisin. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSources: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cura%C3%A7ao_(liqueur)">[1]</a>, <a href="https://bevvy.co/articles/curacao-vs-triple-sec-whats-the-difference/17866">[2]</a>.	30

94	Benedictine	<p>\r\nBénédictine (French pronunciation: ​[benediktin]) is an herbal liqueur produced in France. Flavored with twenty-seven flowers, berries, herbs, roots, and spices, it was developed by wine merchant Alexandre Le Grand in the 19th century, and marketed as having been derived from an original recipe of Benedictine monks of the Abbey of Fécamp in Normandy lost in the ashes of the French Revolution.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA drier version, B&B, blending Bénédictine with brandy, was developed in the 1930s. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1863 Alexandre Le Grand developed a recipe for an herbal liqueur, helped by a local chemist, from old medicinal recipes that he had acquired from a religious foundation where a maternal grandparent had held office as a fiscal prosecutor. To market it, he embellished a story of it having been developed by monks at the Benedictine Abbey of Fécamp in Normandy, and produced by them until the abbey's devastation during the French Revolution. He began production under the trade name "Bénédictine", using a bottle with a distinguishing shape and label. To reinforce his myth, he placed the abbreviation "D.O.M." on the label, for "<i>Deo Optimo Maximo</i>" ("To God, most good, most great"), used at the beginning of documents by the Benedictine Order to dedicate their work.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1982 just 15% of the production of the liqueur was sold in France with 45% of the product going to the United States of America. Benedictine is sold in over two hundred markets. The United Kingdom remains a significant market in Europe where much of the Bénédictine is consumed in the Burnley area of England. This is as a result of returning Great War soldiers of the East Lancashire Regiment acquiring a taste for the drink whilst stationed in France during the War. Traditionally people in East Lancashire drink Bénédictine with hot water, known as 'Béné and hot', and the Burnley Miners Club is reputedly the largest single customer. The abbey at Fécamp was used for a convalescence hospital.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1986, the Martini & Rossi group took control of Bénédictine. In 1992 they in turn were bought out by Bacardi for a reported $1.4 billion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBy 2010 around 75% of the production was exported. This marked a significant increase in its popularity in France. The biggest consumers of Bénédictine are the United States, Malaysia and Singapore. The sales to China is expected to eclipse these markets within the next few years. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Recipe</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nThe recipe is a closely guarded trade secret, purportedly known to only three people at any given time. So many people have tried to reproduce it that the company maintains on its grounds in Fécamp a "Hall of Counterfeits" (<i>Salle des Contrefaçons</i>). The bottle and label have been imitated, as has the name <i>Bénédictine</i>. The company prosecutes those it feels are infringing on its intellectual property.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe manufacturing process involves several distillations which are then blended. The recipe of Bénédictine is a commercial secret, but it is known to contain 27 herbs and spices, of which the following 21 are publicly known: Angelica, hyssop, juniper, myrrh, saffron, mace, fir cones, aloe, arnica, lemon balm, tea, thyme, coriander, clove, lemon, vanilla, orange peel, honey, red berries, cinnamon, and nutmeg; leaving six unknown ingredients.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSources: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9n%C3%A9dictine">[1]</a>.	40

51	Brandy	<p>\r\nBrandy is a spirit produced by distilling wine. Brandy generally contains 35–60% alcohol by volume (70–120 US proof) and is typically drunk as an after-dinner digestif. Some brandies are aged in wooden casks. Others are coloured with caramel colouring to imitate the effect of aging, and some are produced using a combination of both aging and colouring. Varieties of wine brandy can be found across the winemaking world. Among the most renowned are Cognac and Armagnac from southwestern France.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe term <i>brandy</i> is a shortening of <i>brandywine</i>, which was derived from the Dutch word <i>brandewijn</i>, itself derived from <i>gebrande wijn</i>, which literally means "burned wine".\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the general colloquial usage of the term, brandy may also be made from pomace and from fermented fruit other than grapes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf a beverage comes from a particular fruit (or multiple fruits) other than exclusively grapes, or from the must of such fruit, it may be referred to as a "fruit brandy" or "fruit spirit" or named using the specific fruit, such as "peach brandy", rather than just generically as "brandy". If pomace is the raw material, the beverage may be called "pomace brandy", "marc brandy", "grape marc", "fruit marc spirit", or "grape marc spirit"; "marc" being the pulp residue after the juice has been pressed from the fruit.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGrape pomace brandy may be designated as "grappa" or "grappa brandy". Apple brandy may be referred to as "applejack". There is also a product called "grain brandy" that is made from grain spirits.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWithin the European Union, the German term <i>Weinbrand</i> is legally equivalent to the English term "brandy", but outside the German-speaking countries it is particularly used to designate brandy from Austria and Germany. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe origins of brandy are tied to the development of distillation. While the process was known in classical times, it was not used for significant beverage production until the 15th century. In the early 16th century French brandy helped kickstart the triangle trade when it replaced Portuguese fortified wine at the center of the trade due to its higher alcohol content and ease of shipping. Canoemen and guards on the African side of the trade were generally paid in brandy. By the late 17th century rum had replaced brandy as the exchange alcohol of choice in the triangle trade.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nInitially wine was distilled as a preservation method and as a way to make it easier for merchants to transport. It is also thought that wine was originally distilled to lessen the tax which was assessed by volume. The intent was to add the water removed by distillation back to the brandy shortly before consumption. It was discovered that after having been stored in wooden casks, the resulting product had improved over the original distilled spirit. In addition to removing water, the distillation process led to the formation and decomposition of numerous aromatic compounds, fundamentally altering the composition of the distillate from its source. Non-volatile substances such as pigments, sugars, and salts remained behind in the still. As a result, the taste of the distillate was often quite unlike that of the original source. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Technology</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nExcept for few major producers, brandy production and consumption tend to have a regional character and thus production methods significantly vary. Wine brandy is produced from a variety of grape cultivars. A special selection of cultivars, providing distinct aroma and character, is used for high-quality brandies, while cheaper ones are made from whichever wine is available.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBrandy is made from so-called base wine, which significantly differs from regular table wines. It is made from early grapes in order to achieve higher acid concentration and lower sugar levels. Base wine generally contains smaller amount (up to 20 mg/l) of sulphur than regular wines, as it creates undesired copper(II) sulfate in reaction with copper in the pot stills. The yeast sediment produced during the fermentation may or may not be kept in the wine, depending on the brandy style.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBrandy is distilled from the base wine in two phases. In the first, large part of water and solids is removed from the base, obtaining so-called "low wine", basically a concentrated wine with 28–30% ABV. In the second stage, low wine is distilled into brandy. The liquid exits the pot still in three phases, referred to as the "heads", "heart" and "tails" respectively. The first part, the "head," has an alcohol concentration of about 83% (166 US proof) and an unpleasant odour. The weak portion on the end, "tail", is discarded along with the head, and they are generally mixed with another batch of low wine, thereby entering the distillation cycle again. The middle heart fraction, richest in aromas and flavours, is preserved for later maturation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDistillation does not simply enhance the alcohol content of wine. The heat under which the product is distilled and the material of the still (usually copper) cause chemical reactions to take place during distillation. This leads to the formation of numerous new volatile aroma components, changes in relative amounts of aroma components in the wine, and the hydrolysis of components such as esters.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBrandy is usually produced in pot stills (batch distillation), but the column still can also be used for continuous distillation. Distillate obtained in this manner has a higher alcohol concentration (approximately 90% ABV) and is less aromatic. Choice of the apparatus depends on the style of brandy produced. Cognac and South African brandy are examples of brandy produced in batches while many American brandies use fractional distillation in column stills.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Aging</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter distillation, the unaged brandy is placed into oak barrels to mature. Usually, brandies with a natural golden or brown colour are aged in oak casks (single-barrel aging). Some brandies, particularly those from Spain, are aged using the solera system, where the producer changes the barrel each year. After a period of aging, which depends on the style, class and legal requirements, the mature brandy is mixed with distilled water to reduce alcohol concentration and bottled. Some brandies have caramel colour and sugar added to simulate the appearance of barrel aging.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSources: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy">[1]</a>.	40

32	Gomme Syrup	<p>\r\nGomme syrup, or simply <i>gomme</i>, is an ingredient commonly used in mixed drinks. Like bar syrups, it is a sugar and water mixture, but has an added ingredient of gum arabic which acts as an emulsifier. Gomme syrup is made with the highest percentage of sugar to water possible, while the gum arabic prevents the sugar from crystallizing and adds a smooth texture. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSources: <a href="https://cocktails.fandom.com/wiki/Gomme_syrup">[1]</a>.	0
34	Orange Bitters	<p>\r\nOrange bitters is a form of bitters, a cocktail flavoring made from such ingredients as the peels of Seville oranges, cardamom, caraway seed, coriander, anise, and burnt sugar in an alcohol base. Orange bitters, which are not to be confused with standard Angostura aromatic bitters, are currently enjoying a resurgence among cocktail enthusiasts.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor many years, it was difficult to find orange bitters in the United States and elsewhere. Because of this, some cocktail recipes which traditionally contained orange bitters may now exclude that ingredient.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRenowned mixologist Gary Regan created Regan's Orange Bitters in the 1990s.[3] Regan's are bottled and sold by the Sazerac Company, whose CEO, Mark Brown, had worked with Regan to create a modern version of these bitters. Since 2006 The Bitter Truth in Germany has produced all natural orange bitters and there are now a number of different brands on the market.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDifferent orange bitters are sometimes mixed to hit a desired note. For example, a "Feegan's," often used in a Manhattan, consists of an equal-parts mix of Fee Bros West India Orange Bitters and Regans' Orange Bitters No. 6. This is done to balance out the candy like sweetness of Fees and the heavy cardamom note of Regans'.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOrange bitters can also be made at home, allowing one to create new flavor profiles that are not available anywhere else. The process of making orange bitters takes several days.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSource: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_bitters">[1]</a>.	28

162	Vermouth	<h2>What is Vermouth?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEssentially, vermouth is wine that has been both fortified and aromatised. Fortification involves adding grape spirit to wine in order to boost its strength and make it less prone to oxidisation—both Sherry and Port are examples of fortified wines. Aromatisation involves steeping herbs, spices, and various other botanicals in the wine in order to impart flavours that don’t exist naturally within grapes. Most wines that have been aromatised have also been fortified, because low-proof alcohol doesn’t extract flavour from macerated ingredients as efficiently as alcohol of higher proof. (One notable exception is Barolo Chinato, an unfortified Italian red wine infused with bitter cinchona bark.) All vermouths are fortified aromatised wines, but not all fortified aromatised wines are vermouths: the French aperitif wine Lillet Blanc, for example, is both fortified and aromatised, but doesn’t fit the flavour profile of vermouth.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDespite the many varieties of vermouth available, the production method is similar for each: white wine is fortified with grape spirit, infused with a bouquet of botanicals including wormwood, and in certain cases sweetened. The resulting concoction is then aged in barrels to meld the flavours together, then bottled. What determines the differences between types of vermouth are the botanicals used, the sweetener used, and how much of either or both.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVermouth was invented in Torino, Italy, in 1786 by a local distiller, Antonio Benedetto Carpano. Carpano named his creation “vermouth” after <i>wermut</i>, the German word for wormwood, which was used as a bittering agent in early vermouths. (Wormwood is not a necessary component of vermouth, though. This fact perhaps saved vermouth from the anti-wormwood propaganda that was used to destroy the absinthe industry at the start of the twentieth century.) The first vermouth was of a reddish-brown hue owing to the botanicals used and Carpano’s use of caramelised sugar as a sweetener. This style of vermouth came to be known as either sweet, Italian, red, or rosso vermouth; the profusion of synonyms here makes for confusing cocktail recipes. Torino lies within seventy or so kilometres of Italy’s border with France, and just past this border, in Chambéry, French distillers took Carpano’s blueprint and made a drier vermouth with little to no additional sugar, infused with botanicals that wouldn’t colour the wine. This style of vermouth became known as dry or French vermouth. Chambéry is also home to the third major style of vermouth, blanc or bianco vermouth, which is similar to dry vermouth but sweetened with mistelle, a mixture of freshly-pressed grape juice and grape brandy (the brandy prevents yeast from converting the sugar in the juice to alcohol). Like dry vermouth, blanc or bianco vermouth is mostly clear.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBy the late 18th century, homemade vermouths were commonly made in the Piedmont region of Italy. In the decades following Carpano's commercial debut, other vermouth makers began production in Turin: The Cinzano family opened their facility in 1816. Martini & Rossi, now the largest manufacturer of vermouth, started production in 1863.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1813, Joseph Noilly created the style that came to be known as dry vermouth or French vermouth. By 1855, Noilly's son, Louis, and his brother-in-law, Claudius Prat, were producing Noilly Prat dry vermouth in the southern French village of Marseillan. Like the Italian firms, Noilly uses white grapes, specifically Clairette and Picpoul grapes grown in the Languedoc region of France, but doesn't color the wine.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nStarting with the aptly named Vermouth Cocktail, which debuted in print in 1869 and is composed of chilled vermouth with a twist of lemon peel, occasionally accented with dashes of bitters and maraschino liqueur - ample quantities of vermouth were consumed in cocktails in the decades that followed its mixological debut. But by the mid-20th century, bartenders were following the lead of martini drinkers such as Winston Churchill, who is said to have merely glanced at a bottle of vermouth (or, in some versions of the story, in the direction of France) while preparing a drink. This trend toward drier martinis, combined with changing tastes toward lighter-flavored drinks and the advent of the vodka martini, meant vermouth became largely ignored and, as a result, misunderstood. \r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h2>French vs. Italian, Red vs. Blanc vs. Dry</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nDividing vermouth into three types—Italian/red, French/dry, and blanc/bianco—only scratches the surface of vermouth’s complexity. For starters, “Italian” vermouth is often produced by French companies and <em>vice versa</em>, so when a cocktail recipe calls for Italian vermouth it calls for sweet vermouth, not merely any vermouth made in Italy. Then there are regional differences: Dolin’s dry vermouth, made in Chambéry, is much crisper and cleaner than the soft, buttery vermouth made by Noilly Prat in the French coastal town of Marseillan. Italian distillers produce two notable variations on rosso vermouth: <i>vermouth alla vaniglia</i>, to which vanilla and extra sweeteners are added, and <i>vermouth con bitter</i>, which is a premixed cocktail of vermouth and bitters. Finally, there is a string of more recent vermouth products that are decidedly more experimental: there are rosé vermouths such as Martini and Rossi’s Rosato, and amber vermouths such as Noilly Ambre.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis profusion of styles is very confusing, but the good news is that for most purposes you only really need to know the difference between the sweet red and dry varieties. The subtle differences between Chambéry and Marseillan dry vermouths means that each makes a slightly different Dry Martini, but if prepared correctly both will be delicious. Both <i>vermouth alla vaniglia</i> and <i>vermouth con bitter</i> can be used in place of sweet red vermouth, and can be used to make classic cocktails even better (<i>vermouth alla vaniglia</i> makes a killer Manhattan, and <i>vermouth con bitter</i> adds an extra kick to a Negroni). The blanc or bianco style is very rarely called for in cocktails; the rosé and amber styles even less often. The best thing to do with these styles of vermouth is simply to drink them on their own.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSources: <a href="http://www.chadparkhill.com/vermouth/">[1]</a>, <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/wine/article/The-Truth-About-Vermouth-3273102.php">[2]</a>, <a href="https://vermouth101.com/vermouth-styles.html">[3]</a>.	\N

55	Grand Marnier	<p>\r\nGrand Marnier (French pronunciation: ​[ɡʁɑ̃ maʁnje]) is a French brand of liqueurs. The brand's best-known product is Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge, an orange-flavored liqueur created in 1880 by Alexandre Marnier-Lapostolle. It is made from a blend of Cognac brandy, distilled essence of bitter orange, and sugar. Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge is 40% alcohol (70 proof in UK, 80 proof in US).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAside from Cordon Rouge, the Grand Marnier line includes other liqueurs, most of which can be consumed "neat" as a cordial or a digestif, and can be used in mixed drinks and desserts. In France, this kind of use is the most popular, especially with crêpes Suzette and crêpes au Grand Marnier.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nAccording to their official website, Grand Marnier's first distillery was built in 1827 by Jean Baptiste Lapostolle in the small city of Neauphle-le-Château. His granddaughter Julia married Louis-Alexandre Marnier in 1876 and, four years later, the Marnier's released a signature cognac with Caribbean bitter orange.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCésar Ritz (1850–1918) reportedly came up with the name "Grand Marnier" for Marnier-Lapostolle, who in return helped him purchase and establish the Hotel Ritz Paris. During the extravangant La Belle Époque, Grand Marnier was served in the Ritz Hotel as well as the Savoy Hotel. The brand has released anniversary editions of their well-known liqueur lines and became popular in the United States in the 1980s.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOn March 15, 2016, the Campari Group announced a friendly takeover offer for Société des Produits Marnier Lapostolle S.A., the owner of Grand Marnier. \r\n</p>	40
16	Dry Gin	A variety of Gins.\r\n\r\nThis variety of spirits is highly regulated so below is thorough analysis of what <i>can be called</i> a London Dry (from <a href="https://theginisin.com/regulations/what-is-london-dry-gin/">here</a>).\r\n\r\n<h2>What is London Dry Gin?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2019, the European Union collected feedback from consumers and the distilling industry to help clarify its meaning. Though there are some changes in the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019R0787">new 2019/787 legislation</a>, the core of the matter has not changed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHistorically the term London Dry Gin has been a quality control designation and not a flavor designation. In 2020, the term London Dry Gin is <i>still</i> a <b>process designation</b>. Though some efforts have been made to add clarity to the defining the flavor of gin, they continue to remain subjective and largely unenforceable.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Details on Distillation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe purity standard of the base spirits has its origins in the 18th and 19th centuries. Gins were being distilled from all sorts of grains, some wholesome, some were destined to be waste. The grain spirits were often rough, and often were sweetened or otherwise adulterated to make them palatable.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe invention of the continuous column still made it easier for distillers to create clean, high proof spirits. A wine in a pot still may be close to 50% alcohol vapor, but that same wine in a column still can reach 96%, the limit able to be achieved through distillation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFirstly, a “London Gin is Distilled Gin” (p. 41). Distilled Gin has its own set of requirements.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSection 21.a of Regulation 2019/787 requires a distilled gin to be made with the following:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nThe base spirit must be of agricultural origin. Secondly, it must be distilled to an “initial alcoholic strength of at least 96%.” In essence it says, “the base spirit must be distilled in a column still and be completely and truly neutral.”\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe truly neutral base spirit is then redistilled “in the presence of <i>Juniperus communis L.</i> and other botanicals.”\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFurthermore, “the combination of the product of such distillation and ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin with the same composition, purity and alcoholic strength; flavoring substances or flavoring preparations as specified in point (c) of category 20 or both may also be used to flavor distilled gin” \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis clause means that gins like <i>Martin Miller’s</i> or <i>Hendrick’s</i> which add flavoring elements after distillation are still considered <i>distilled gins</i> as the first two steps are true. It further codifies that the “concentrate” method of distilling— where a distiller runs a super intense botanical run and then dilutes it with neutral spirit to appropriate intensity— also still qualifies as a “distilled gin.” \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou can add flavoring <b>and</b> neutral alcohol to a distilled gin. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFurther, a distilled gin may be designated as “dry” if it does not add more than 0.1 grams of sweetening products per liter. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAgain <b>dry means that a gin is (for the most part) unsweetened.</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Standards for botanicals</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe vague taste standards specified under previous European Union spirit drinks regulation in part led to why so many gin distillers wanted to recodify gin law.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, there are no improvements. The vague “predominant flavor” clause remains.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGin is defined under 20.c: “Only flavoring substances or flavoring preparations or both shall be used for the production of gin so that the taste is predominantly that of juniper.”\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDistilled gin refines it under 21.a.i: “in the presence of juniper berries (Juniperus communis L.) and of other natural botanicals, provided that the juniper taste is predominant.”\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLondon Gin inherits both of these clauses and refines it further to exclude any gin which adds flavors after distillation. “the flavor of which is imparted exclusively through the distillation of ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin in the presence of all the natural plant materials used.”\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAgain, I find it fascinating that the vague term “plant” is included. Technically speaking this means that a gin such as <i>Radoune</i> which uses mushrooms could not be considered a London Gin (mushrooms are fungi, not plants).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFurther the “exclusively through” clause means that <i>Portobello Road’s Directors Cut Pechuga-style London Dry Gin</i> would no longer be afforded the “London” designation. Their pechuga is made by suspending raw meat in the still which is cooked through the distillation process, and whose flavor is imparted by vapor infusion. Meat, being from animals rather than plants, would also be excluded from London Gins.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis clause was present in the 2009 guidelines as well; however, it is not clear to what extent this will be enforced, given its rarity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis does not mean that London Gin is vegetarian. The agricultural origin of base spirit is sufficiently expansive to include fermentable animal products like milk and whey.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis means that any flavors, macerations, or botanicals added after final distillation disqualifies a gin from being called a London Dry Gin. Several notable gins including <i>Martin Miller’s Gin</i> and <i>Hendricks Gin</i> are often mistaken for London Dry Gins. However, both Miller’s adds cucumber and Hendrick’s adds that and rose after distillation. Therefore, they cannot bear the name “London Dry Gin.”\r\n</p>	40
56	Kummel	<p>\r\nKümmel, also called kummel or kimmel, is a sweet, colorless liqueur flavored with caraway seed, cumin, and fennel.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAccording to some historians, kümmel liqueur was first distilled in the Netherlands during the late 16th century by Lucas Bols. It was then taken to Germany and Russia; the former is now the principal producer and consumer of kümmel.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAn extended history is that kümmel increased its popularity during the early 19th Century, being produced by 1823 in the village of Allažmuiža (Allaž Manor -- Allasch in German) in modern day Latvia, which at the time was part of the Russian Empire, but which had a German-speaking aristocracy and a sizable German minority population. Kümmel was produced by a Baltic German aristocrat, Baron von Blanckenhagen, who owned land around Allažmuiža which included a pure and reliable water source.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the mid-19th Century, kümmel was every bit the rival of gin and being made with caraway rather than juniper, it had one main advantage. Caraway has a calmative effect, reducing flatulence and the bloated feeling experienced after a heavy meal. By 1850, this ″medicinal″ benefit helped Ludwig Mentzendorff create a healthy business importing kümmel to Britain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1905 amid the turmoil of revolutionary Russia, the Blanckenhagen mansion was burned down. The distillery closed, and the entrepreneurial Mentzendorffs opened up production of their own kümmel in France. Baltic Germans moved ‘back’ to Germany as tensions between Russia and Germany grew, and several distilleries in Germany produced their own versions of kümmel, where it is still known as Allasch and is a popular digestif.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the UK, it is a popular drink at many of the more traditional golf clubs.[4]. Because of its rumored ability to steady the nerves of golfers there, it acquired the nickname of ″putting mixture″.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSource: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCmmel_(liqueur)">[1]</a>.	38
163	Triple Sec	<p>\r\nTriple sec, originally Curaçao triple sec, is a type of strong, sweet and colorless orange-flavored liqueur. It is a variety of Curaçao liqueur, an orange-flavored liqueur made from the dried peels of bitter and sweet oranges.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Sec" is the French word for dry. The etymology of the term "triple sec" is unclear.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTriple sec may be consumed neat as a digestif, or on the rocks. However, it is more typically used as an ingredient in a variety of cocktails, such as sangria, Margarita, Kamikaze, White Lady, Long Island Iced Tea, Sidecar, Skittle Bomb, Corpse Reviver #2 and Cosmopolitan.\r\n</p>	40
58	Peach Brandy	Strong spirit made out of fermented peaches.	40
59	White Wine	<p>\r\nWhite wine is a wine that is fermented without skin contact. The colour can be straw-yellow, yellow-green, or yellow-gold. It is produced by the alcoholic fermentation of the non-coloured pulp of grapes, which may have a skin of any colour. White wine has existed for at least 2500 years.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe wide variety of white wines comes from the large number of varieties, methods of winemaking, and ratios of residual sugar. White wine is mainly from "white" grapes, which are green or yellow in colour, such as the Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, and Riesling. Some white wine is also made from grapes with coloured skin, provided that the obtained wort is not stained. Pinot noir, for example, is commonly used to produce champagne. \r\n</p>	12
61	Calvados	<p>\r\nCalvados (UK: /ˈkælvədɒs/, US: /-doʊs, ˌkælvəˈdoʊs, ˌkɑːlvəˈ-/; French: [kalvados]) is an apple or pear brandy from Normandy in France.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n<h3>In France</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nApple orchards and brewers are mentioned as far back as the 8th century by Charlemagne. The first known Norman distillation was carried out by Gilles Picot, Lord de Gouberville, in 1553, and the guild for cider distillation was created about 50 years later in 1606. In the 17th century, the traditional cider farms expanded, but taxation and prohibition of cider brandies were enforced elsewhere than Brittany, Maine, and Normandy. The area called "Calvados" was created after the French Revolution, but <i>eau de vie de cidre</i> was already called <i>calvados</i> in common usage. In the 19th century, output increased with industrial distillation and the working class fashion for <i>café-calva</i>. When a phylloxera outbreak in the last quarter of the 19th century devastated the vineyards of France and Europe, calvados experienced a "golden age". During World War I, cider brandy was requisitioned for use in armaments due to its alcohol content. The <i>appellation contrôlée</i> regulations officially gave calvados a protected name in 1942. After the war, many cider houses and distilleries were reconstructed, mainly in the Pays d'Auge. Many of the traditional farmhouse structures were replaced by modern agriculture with high output. The calvados appellation system was revised in 1984 and 1996. Pommeau got its recognition in 1991; in 1997, an appellation for Domfront with 30% pears was created.\r\n\r\n<h3>Elsewhere</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nCider brandy is also made in the UK, and appears in records going back to 1678. Somerset cider brandy gained European protected geographical indication (PGI) status in 2011.\r\n\r\n<h2>Recipe</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nCalvados is distilled from cider made from specially grown and selected apples, from over 200 named varieties. It is not uncommon for a calvados producer to use over 100 specific varieties of apples, which are either sweet (such as the 'Rouge Duret' variety), tart (such as the 'Rambault' variety), or bitter (such as the 'Mettais', 'Saint Martin', 'Frequin', and 'Binet Rouge' varieties), the latter being inedible.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe fruit is harvested and pressed into a juice that is fermented into a dry cider. It is then distilled into <i>eau de vie</i>. After two years of aging in oak casks, it can be sold as calvados. The longer it is aged, the smoother the drink becomes. Usually, the maturation goes on for several years. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe appellation of AOC (appellation d'origine contrôlée) for calvados authorizes double distillation for all calvados, but it is required for the Calvados Pays d'Auge.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Double distillation is carried out in a traditional alembic pot still, called either l'alambic à repasse or charentais</li>\r\n<li>Single continuous distillation in a column still</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe usual arguments for and against the two processes are that the former process gives the spirit complexity and renders it suitable for longer aging, whilst the latter process gives the calvados a fresh and clean apple flavour but with less complexity. In fact, a growing belief indicates a well-operated column still can produce as complex and "age-able" calvados as double distillation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSource: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvados">[1]</a>.	40

64	Hercules	<p>\r\nThe Savoy Cocktail Book lists several recipes that call for Hercules. But what, exactly, was Hercules? Answering that question has been a—oh, forgive me—a Herculean task. Erik Ellestad, in his <a href="http://savoystomp.com/">Stomping Through the Savoy</a> project, tried every cocktail in the Savoy, even the ones that sucked. One challenge he faced was trying to determine just what the heck Hercules was. For starters, bottles of the stuff seem to be nearly impossible to find, so tasting or analyzing it is out of the question. For a long time, cocktail geeks argued that Hercules was an absinthe substitute. Then, by finding old advertisements, which ran in papers and magazines at around the time the Savoy was published, Ellestad and others reached the conclusion that it was a red-wine aperitif, similar to vermouth, but spiced with yerba maté and other (unknown) herbs. Maté, incidentally, tastes a bit like green tea and contains caffeine, so any cocktails made with Hercules would have carried a mild jolt. No one, to my knowledge, has attempted a commercial resurrection of Hercules, although Ellestad has shared recipes. I should note, though, that Erik has never tried the original, and he's not even trying to duplicate it. What Erik's trying to achieve is a tasty maté-infused aperitif, one that sips well on its own but also works in the Savoy cocktails.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>First iteration</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>1 bottle Navarro White Table Wine</li>\r\n<li>1/4 cup Yerba Mate</li>\r\n<li>1 tablespoon Gentian</li>\r\n<li>1 clove</li>\r\n<li>Dried Peel from 1 Seville Orange</li>\r\n<li>1/2 stick Ceylon Cinnamon</li>\r\n<li>1/2 cup sugar</li>\r\n<li>1/4 cup Havana Club 8 Year Rum</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Method: Combine all ingredients other than rum, bring to 140 degrees for 10 minutes. Strain off solids, cool, and add rum. Refrigerate.</i>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI purposely kept this simple, to try and get more of a feel for appropriate taste combinations with the Yerba Mate. Initial thoughts are that it has too much gentian to be drunk on it’s own for pleasure. But it’s close. Tasting other vermouth I have around, I find many seem to have more culinary herbs in the middle flavors than this. Might have to experiment with including some thyme, mint, or oregano next time. I’m also not sure if the color came from the wine or if it was colored, so skipped that for the time being. Since most vermouth is made on a white wine base, I would guess it was colored, perhaps with cochineal or similar.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Second iteration</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>1 bottle Navarro Chardonnay</li>\r\n<li>1/4 cup Yerba Mate</li>\r\n<li>1/2 tsp oregano</li>\r\n<li>2 tsp Gentian</li>\r\n<li>2 tsp Cinchona Powder</li>\r\n<li>1/2 tsp Wormwood flowers and leaves</li>\r\n<li>4 whole cloves</li>\r\n<li>Dried Peel from 1 Seville Orange</li>\r\n<li>1 stick Ceylon Cinnamon</li>\r\n<li>1/2 tsp whole coriander seed</li>\r\n<li>1/2 cup sugar</li>\r\n<li>1/4 cup Apple Brandy</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Method: Combine all ingredients other than brandy, bring to 140 degrees for 10 minutes.

68	Rye Whisky	<p>\r\nRye whiskey can refer to two different, but related, types of whiskey:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>American rye whiskey, which is similar to bourbon whiskey, but must be distilled from at least 51 percent rye grain</li>\r\n<li>Canadian whisky, which is often referred to as (and often labelled as) rye whisky for historical reasons, although it may or may not actually include any rye grain in its production process.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>History</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRye whiskey was historically the prevalent whiskey in the northeastern states, especially Pennsylvania and Maryland. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was the center of rye whiskey production in the late 1700s and early 1800s. By 1808, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania farmers were selling one half barrel for each man, woman and child in the country. By the 1880s, Joseph F. Sinnott's distillery, Moore and Sinnott, located in Monongahela, Pennsylvania, was the single largest producer of rye whiskey, with a capacity of 30,000 barrels a year.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRye whiskey largely disappeared after Prohibition. A few brands, such as Old Overholt, survived, although by the late 1960s former Pennsylvania brands like Old Overholt were being distilled mostly in Kentucky.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the early 21st century, an expanding number of brands are produced by Campari Group (Wild Turkey Rye), Diageo (George Dickel Rye and Bulleit Rye), Heaven Hill (Pikesville Rye and Rittenhouse Rye), Beam Suntory (Old Overholt and Jim Beam Rye), The Sazerac Company (Col. E. H. Taylor, Sazerac Rye, and Thomas H. Handy), and various smaller companies. A particularly large producer is MGP of Indiana (formerly known as Lawrenceburg Distillers Indiana), which is a distiller for many brands that are marketed by others (including some of the large companies previously listed).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRye whiskey has been undergoing a small but growing revival in the United States. Since the beginning of the 21st century, more producers have been experimenting with rye whiskey, and several now market aged rye whiskey. For example, Brown-Forman began production of a Jack Daniel's rye whiskey and released unaged and lightly aged versions as limited editions. A reconstructed distillery at Mount Vernon (the estate of George Washington) sells a rye that is similar to the whiskey Washington made. At its peak, Washington's original distillery was among the largest producers of rye whiskey in the United States, averaging 11,000 gallons per year.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Canadian Rye Whisky</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nCanadian whisky is often referred to as "rye whisky" because historically much of the content was from rye. There is no requirement for rye to be used to make Canadian whisky, and the labels "Canadian whisky", "Canadian rye whisky" and "Rye whisky" are all legally permitted, regardless of the actual composition, provided the whiskies "possess the aroma, taste and character generally attributed to Canadian whisky".\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn modern practice, most Canadian whiskies are blended to achieve this character, primarily consisting of a high-proof base whisky typically made from corn or wheat and aged in used barrels combined with a small amount of flavoring whisky made from a rye mash and distilled to a lower proof. In some cases, the corn-to-rye ratio may be as high as 9:1. There are a few exceptions, such as Alberta Premium and Canadian Club Chairman's Select, which are made from 100% rye mash.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCanadian whisky must be aged in wooden barrels that are not larger than 700 litres (154 imp gal; 185 US gal) for at least three years, and the barrels do not have to be new oak or charred. This requirement differs from regulations for U.S. blended whiskey, in which the bulk base spirits are not required to be aged. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSources: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rye_whiskey">[1]</a>.	40

71	Currant Syrup	A mixture of currant juice with sugar.	0
74	Dry Sherry	<p>\r\nA drier subvariety of spanish fortified vines from Jerez region.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDry Sherry wines are produced by complete fermentation and thus have a minimal content of residual sugar from the grape juice. Within this group of dry wines we distinguish four different types depending on whether they were aged in what we call “biological ageing” or “oxidative ageing” or a combination of both. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo select the type of ageing, the wines are fortified with wine-based alcohol to different levels: to 15% if the growth of flor is desired or to 17% in the case of oxidative ageing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Fino</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFino wine is a dry Sherry which owes its characteristics to being aged entirely biologically; that is to say the wine has aged in the interior of the butts always protected by a film of yeast, the “veil of flor” which has prevented it from oxidising. Its colour is a very pale straw yellow and its aromas and flavours are due above all to these yeasts which make up the veil of flor and which are constantly interacting with the wine. The wines are fresh and crisp on the nose with almond notes very characteristic of the yeast with a very dry flavour and low acidity. Their alcohol content is usually about 15%.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Oloroso</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOloroso is at the other extreme of the generoso wines because its ageing is of an exclusively oxidative nature. With the passage of time its colour – originally similar to that of Fino - deepens towards intense amber, and the older it gets, the darker it gets. It offers a great wealth of aromas including nuts, tobacco, spices, even animal notes (leather) and exotic woods. They are powerful wines on the palate with more alcohol and texture thanks to the concentration of dry extract in the wine during ageing. The content of both alcohol and glycerine increase over time giving the wine a smoothness on the palate and a certain unctuousness as well as great length. The alcohol level of Oloroso is usually around 18% - 20%.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Amontillado</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nAmontillado is a wine which initially follows the same production process as Fino, but after completing its biological ageing it continues to age, this time without the veil of flor and is thus exposed to oxidation which gives it its organoleptic characteristics. Golden to mahogany in colour, gently crisp on the nose with notes of hazelnut, it is more structured and alcoholic than Fino on the palate, dry with notes of spice and wood, and with great persistence. Its strength is usually between 17% and 20%.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Palo Cortado</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nPalo Cortado is also a wine aged oxidatively but unlike Oloroso it is made from young wines which were initially classified for their finesse and suitable for the production of Fino or Manzanilla, that is to say for biological ageing, for which they were initially fortified to 15%. Later on in the first stages of the ageing process it is decided to change the destiny of the wine by refortifying it to 17%, thus eliminating the possibility of any further development under a veil of flor. Hence the name Palo Cortado. These wines are similar to Olorosos but with a lighter structure and great elegance but otherwise share most of the same organoleptic characteristics. Their alcoholic strength usually lies between 18% and 20%\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Manzanilla</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nManzanilla is a wine aged biologically in the coastal town of Sanlúcar de Barrameda and protected by a specific Denomination of Origin: “Manzanilla - Sanlúcar de Barrameda”. From a technical point of view, Manzanilla could be described as identical to Fino in respect of both its production and its organoleptic characteristics. Nevertheless, the particular microclimatic conditions of Sanlúcar and the influence of these on the flor give the wine subtly different characteristics to Fino: a generally lighter structure, floral notes on the nose and an elegant bitterness on the palate at the finish.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSources: <a href="https://www.sherry.wine/sherry-cask/types-of-sherry-wine">[1]</a>.	17

31	Gin	<p>\r\nGin is a distilled alcoholic drink that derives its predominant flavour from juniper berries (<i>Juniperus communis</i>). Gin is one of the broadest categories of spirits, all of various origins, styles, and flavour profiles, that revolve around juniper as a common ingredient.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGin was invented in the southern Italian city of Salerno, in the 12th century, where the first traces of wine distillates with infused herbs are referenced in the Compendium Salernitanum of the Schola Medica Salernitana. The school was an important source of medical knowledge for Western Europe at the time and gin was often called 'aqua vita'(water of life). Gin began it's life as a medicinal liquor and monks in Italy were swiftly followed by other monks and alchemists across Europe, particularly Southern France, Flanders and the Netherlands - where gin is often incorrectly believed to have been invented, to provide aqua vita from distilles grapes and grains. It then became an object of commerce in the spirits industry. Gin emerged in England after the introduction of the jenever, a Dutch and Belgian liquor which originally had been a medicine. Although this development had been taking place since early 17th century, gin became widespread after the William of Orange-led 1688 Glorious Revolution and subsequent import restrictions on French brandy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGin today is produced in subtly different ways, from a wide range of herbal ingredients, giving rise to a number of distinct styles and brands. After juniper, gin tends to be flavoured with botanical/herbal, spice, floral or fruit-flavours or often a combination. It is most commonly consumed mixed with tonic water. Gin is also often used as a base spirit to produce flavoured gin-based liqueurs such as, for example, Sloe gin, traditionally by the addition of fruit, flavourings and sugar.\r\n</p>	40
28	Absinthe	<p>\r\nAbsinthe is historically described as a distilled, highly alcoholic beverage (45–74% ABV / 90–148 U.S. proof). It is an anise-flavoured spirit derived from botanicals, including the flowers and leaves of <i>Artemisia absinthium</i> ("grand wormwood"), together with green anise, sweet fennel, and other medicinal and culinary herbs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAbsinthe traditionally has a natural green color but may also be colorless. It is commonly referred to in historical literature as <i>la fée verte</i> ("the green fairy"). It is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a liqueur, but it is not traditionally bottled with added sugar and is, therefore, classified as a spirit. Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water before being consumed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAbsinthe originated in the canton of Neuchâtel in Switzerland in the late 18th century. It rose to great popularity as an alcoholic drink in late 19th- and early 20th-century France, particularly among Parisian artists and writers. The consumption of absinthe was opposed by social conservatives and prohibitionists, partly due to its association with bohemian culture. From Europe and the Americas, notable absinthe drinkers included Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Amedeo Modigliani, Pablo Picasso, Vincent van Gogh, Oscar Wilde, Marcel Proust, Aleister Crowley, Erik Satie, Edgar Allan Poe, Lord Byron and Alfred Jarry.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAbsinthe has often been portrayed as a dangerously addictive psychoactive drug and hallucinogen. The chemical compound thujone, which is present in the spirit in trace amounts, was blamed for its alleged harmful effects. By 1915, absinthe had been banned in the United States and in much of Europe, including France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and Austria–Hungary, yet it has not been demonstrated to be any more dangerous than ordinary spirits. Recent studies have shown that absinthe's psychoactive properties have been exaggerated, apart from that of the alcohol.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA revival of absinthe began in the 1990s, following the adoption of modern European Union food and beverage laws that removed long-standing barriers to its production and sale. By the early 21st century, nearly 200 brands of absinthe were being produced in a dozen countries, most notably in France, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, and the Czech Republic.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSources: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absinthe">[1]</a>	60
35	French Vermouth	<p>\r\nSub variety of generic wormwood-based fortified aperitifs called Vermouths.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCompared to Italians these are dry and/or white-wine based, generally with more subtle taste palette.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>"True" French-style vermouth's<h2>\r\n<h3>Marseilles Dry</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nProvençe, France developed its own successful vermouth tradition in the early 19th Century, possibly beating the Italians into the export business. There, the vermouth was both for drinking and for use as a cooking ingredient, such as for fish sauces. While there once were various producers in Marseilles able to take advantage of the local port for export, those products disappeared long ago as the style focused on what was its first and now its only representative: Noilly Prat (produced for nearly its entire history quite some distance down the coast in Languedoc, in a town called <i>Marseillan</i>).\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Noilly Prat Original French Dry</li>\r\n<li>Noilly Prat Extra Dry</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Chambéry Dry Vermouth</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nChambéry developed a regionally-characteristic lighter, subtler style of dry vermouth in the 19th Century, without any of the oxidation flavors of the Marseilles style. This style enjoyed a period of popularity during the austere mid-20th Century United States market, with Chambéry producers like Lejon, Dolin and Boissiere spawning much imitation, even driving Marseilles dry vermouth producer Noilly Prat to start producing a Chambéry-influenced style (today known as Noilly Prat Extra Dry) exclusively for the American market.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Dolin Dry</li>\r\n<li>Routin Dry</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>Sweeter Blancs</h2>\r\n<h3>Chambéry Blanc</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nColorless sweet vermouth style invented and/or commercialized by Chambéry producer Dolin. The blanc style is frequently generalized as more herb-centric and less spicy than Torino-style rosso vermouth. Note that popular “bianco” vermouths from Italy were, one way or another (directly or indirectly) inspired by Chambéry Blanc, but evince different priorities (see below).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Dolin Blanc</li>\r\n<li>Routin Blanc</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Vermouth Bianco (Italian white vermouth)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the early years of the 20th Century, when Italian vermouth producers were diversifying their export product lines, some began introducing their own “bianco” style, loosely inspired by the Chambèry Blanc style (see above), but much bolder-flavored, and, if current examples are representative, often vanilla-forward and “feminine” (in sexist market-speak). Bianco vermouths remained a relatively obscure sideline to the red and dry vermouths until the late 20th/early 21st Century, when they abruptly became fashionable in large markets such as Russia, and now compete with red vermouths in total sales volumes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Alessio Bianco</li>\r\n<li>Carpano Bianco</li>\r\n<li>Cinzano Bianco</li>\r\n<li>Contratto Bianco</li>\r\n<li>Gancia Bianco</li>\r\n<li>Martini Bianco</li>\r\n<li>Alberto Bianco</li>\r\n<li>Vermouth del Professore Bianco</li>\r\n</ul>	18
18	Orange Juice	<p>\r\nOrange juice is a liquid extract of the orange tree fruit, produced by squeezing or reaming oranges. It comes in several different varieties, including blood orange, navel oranges, valencia orange, clementine, and tangerine. As well as variations in oranges used, some varieties include differing amounts of juice vesicles, known as "pulp" in American English, and "(juicy) bits" in British English. These vesicles contain the juice of the orange and can be left in or removed during the manufacturing process. How juicy these vesicles are depend upon many factors, such as species, variety, and season. In American English, the beverage name is often abbreviated as "OJ".\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCommercial orange juice with a long shelf life is made by pasteurizing the juice and removing the oxygen from it. This removes much of the taste, necessitating the later addition of a flavor pack, generally made from orange products. Additionally, some juice is further processed by drying and later rehydrating the juice, or by concentrating the juice and later adding water to the concentrate.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe health value of orange juice is debatable: it has a high concentration of vitamin C, but also a very high concentration of simple sugars, comparable to soft drinks. As a result, some government nutritional advice has been adjusted to encourage substitution of orange juice with raw fruit, which is digested more slowly, and limit daily consumption.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSources: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_juice">[1]</a>.	0
45	Kirsch	<p>\r\nA kirschwasser (/ˈkɪərʃvɑːsər/, UK also /-væsər/; German: [ˈkɪʁʃvasɐ], German for "cherry water") or kirsch is a clear, colorless brandy traditionally made from double distillation of morello cherries, a dark-colored cultivar of the sour cherry. However, it is now also made from other kinds of cherries. The cherries are fermented completely, including their stones. Unlike cherry liqueurs and cherry brandies, kirschwasser is not sweet. Kirsch is sometimes produced via the distillation of fermented cherry juice.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe best kirschwassers have a refined taste with subtle flavors of cherry and a slight bitter-almond taste that derives from the cherry seeds.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Origin and production</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBecause morellos were originally grown in the Black Forest regions of Germany, kirschwasser is believed to have originated there.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nKirschwasser is colourless because it is either not aged in wood or is aged in barrels made of ash. It may have been aged in paraffin-lined wood barrels or in earthenware vessels.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn France and in English-speaking countries, clear fruit brandies are known as eaux de vie. The European Union sets a minimum of 37.5% ABV (75 proof) for products of this kind; kirschwasser typically has an alcohol content of 40%–50% ABV (80–100 proof). About 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of cherries go into the making of a 750 ml bottle of kirschwasser. \r\n</p>	40
46	Cointreau	<p>\r\nCointreau (UK: /ˈkwɒntroʊ, ˈkwɑːn-/, US: /kwɑːnˈtroʊ, kwæ̃ˈ-/, French: [kwɛ̃tʁo]) is an orange-flavoured triple sec liqueur produced in Saint-Barthélemy-d'Anjou, France. It is consumed as an apéritif and digestif, and is a component of several well-known cocktails. It was originally called Curaçao Blanco Triple Sec. Despite the orange bottle, Cointreau is colourless. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nCointreau Distillery was set up in 1849 by Adolphe Cointreau, a confectioner, and his brother Edouard-Jean Cointreau. Their first success was with the cherry liqueur guignolet, but they found success when they blended sweet and bitter orange peels and pure alcohol from sugar beets. The first bottles of Cointreau were sold in 1875. An estimated 13 million bottles are sold each year, in more than 150 countries. Ninety percent of production is exported. Cointreau & Cie SA was family-owned until 1990, when it merged with Rémy Martin to form Rémy Cointreau, now a publicly traded company.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe production methods and recipe are a family secret, but tours of the facility are open to the public. Photography is restricted in many areas to protect the production process from being copied. \r\n</p>	40
48	Crème de Cacao	Crème de cacao is an example of a broad family of liqueurs that tastes like chocolate.\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere is mention, in French, of producing and selling chocolate <i>en liqueur</i> as early as 1666. Context suggests this is a chocolate liqueur, not a chocolate liquor or other chocolate beverage. In New England prior to the 18th century American Revolution, a "chocolate wine" was popular. Its ingredients included sherry, port, chocolate, and sugar. A French manual published in 1780 also describes chocolate liqueur. An 1803 French pharmacy manual includes a recipe for a chocolate liqueur (<i>ratafia de chocolat</i>, also <i>ratafia de cacao</i>). An early 19th-century American cookbook, published in 1825 and preserved in an historical archive in South Carolina, includes a similar recipe. Throughout the 19th century and into the early 20th century, manuals and encyclopedias in French, English, and Spanish give similar recipes. A late 19th century food science manual gives a recipe that includes techniques for clarifying and coloring the liqueur. A similar early 20th century manual gives four recipes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs of 1994, there were several brands of chocolate liqueur on the market; this is attributed to a 1990s "chocolate craze".\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Varieties</h2>\r\n\r\nThere are three types of chocolate liqueur: liqueur, cream liqueur, and crème de cacao.\r\n\r\n<h3>Chocolate liqueur</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Afrikoko (coconut and chocolate)</li>\r\n<li>Ashanti Gold</li>\r\n<li>Bicerin Di Giandujotto</li>\r\n<li>Djangoa (with a hint of anise)</li>\r\n<li>Godiva Dark Chocolate</li>\r\n<li>Liqueur Fogg</li>\r\n<li>Mozart Black (dark chocolate)</li>\r\n<li>Royal Mint-Chocolate Liqueur (French)</li>\r\n<li>Sabra liqueur (dark chocolate and Jaffa oranges)</li>\r\n<li>Thornton's Chocolate Liqueur</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Chocolate cream liqueur</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Cadbury Cream Liqueur</li>\r\n<li>Dooley's White Chocolate Cream Liqueur</li>\r\n<li>Dwersteg's Organic Chocolate Cream Liqueur</li>\r\n<li>Godiva White Chocolate</li>\r\n<li>Florcello Chocolate Orange Cream Liqueur</li>\r\n<li>Mozart Gold Chocolate Cream Liqueur</li>\r\n<li>Mozart White Chocolate Cream Liqueur</li>\r\n<li>Vana Tallinn Chocolate Cream</li>\r\n<li>Vermeer Dutch Chocolate Cream Liqueur</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Crème de cacao</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCrème de cacao may be either clear or a dark caramel color, which is often labeled "dark crème de cacao". The French word "crème" refers to the creamy texture of this very sweet liqueur, achieved by having a sugar content of at least 250 g/l as required by European law, and there is no dairy cream in it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe alcohol content of crème de cacao varies, but 20% to 25% ABV (40–50 proof (U.S.)) is common. \r\n</p>	17
44	Yellow Chartreuse	<p>\r\nMilder and sweeter than the famous Green Chartreuse, Yellow Chartreuse was introduced to the world in 1840. It also is presented in the traditional Chartreuse liqueur bottle embossed with the seal of La Grande Chartreuse. Its colour is entirely natural with no artificial flavours or preservatives. It, too, can be enjoyed neat or in a long drink.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOnly two Chartreuse monks know the identity of the 130 plants, how to blend them and how to distill them into this world famous liqueur. They are also the only ones who know which plants they have to macerate to produce the natural green and yellow colours. And they alone supervise the slow ageing in oak casks.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ingredients : alcohol, sugar, 130 plants and flowers.</li>\r\n<li>Alcohol content : 40% (80° proof US)</li>\r\n<li>Presentation : Packaged in a traditional Chartreuse liqueur bottle. Very elegant with the embossed seal of La Grande Chartreuse.</li>\r\n<li>How to drink it: To bring out all its flavour, it should be consumed very cold, even on the rocks. Traditionally considered an after dinner drink, Chartreuse is more and more being enjoyed as a long drink.</li>\r\n</ul>	40
52	Crème de Menthe	<p>\r\nCrème de menthe (pronounced [kʁɛm də mɑ̃t], French for "mint cream") is a sweet, mint-flavored alcoholic beverage. It is available commercially in a colorless version (called "white") and a green version (colored by the mint leaves or by added coloring if made from extract instead of leaves). Both varieties have similar flavor and are interchangeable in recipes, except where color is important. It typically has 25% alcohol by volume.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCrème de menthe is an ingredient in several cocktails, such as the Grasshopper and the Stinger. It is also served as a digestif and used in cooking as a flavoring (see Mint chocolate). It is also a primary component of the popular South African shooter known as the Springbokkie. \r\n</p>	25

When a mixed drink recipe specifies “Italian vermouth” or “sweet vermouth”, a product from this style is implied.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVermouth di Torino has protected designation of origin, but it is not enforced at the behest of the industry, because few brands would meet the requirements. Arguably, this is a supply issue, with international product demand outstripping the wine production capacity of the region. One example that arguably meets the designation of origin is Cocchi Vermouth di Torino.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Carpano Classico</li>\r\n<li>Cinzano Rosso</li>\r\n<li>Cocchi Vermouth di Torino</li>\r\n<li>Contratto Vermouth Rosso</li>\r\n<li>Gancia Rosso</li>\r\n<li>Casa Martelletti Vermouth Classico</li>\r\n<li>Martini & Rossi Rosso</li>\r\n<li>Stock Sweet Vermouth Rosso</li>\r\n<li>Mancino Rosso Amaranto</li>\r\n<li>Alessio Rosso</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Vermouth Alla Vaniglia</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA traditional regional style of flavored vermouth: Vermouth di Torino with added vanilla flavoring. Adulterating Vermouth di Torino with bitters or vanilla flavoring—almost like a cockail—when drinking it is an Turinese custom almost as old as vermouth itself; this style has vanilla built-in. Because of the vanilla, this style of vermouth plays especially well with the significant caramel components and bold flavors of bourbon and straight rye whiskey.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSources: <a href="https://vermouth101.com/vermouth-styles.html">[1]</a>.	14.4
38	Scotch Whisky	<p>\r\nScotch whisky (Scottish Gaelic: uisge-beatha na h-Alba; often simply called whisky or Scotch) is malt whisky or grain whisky (or a blend of the two), made in Scotland. Scotch whisky must be made in a manner specified by law. As of 2018, there were 133 Scotch whisky distilleries operating in Scotland.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll Scotch whisky was originally made from malted barley. Commercial distilleries began introducing whisky made from wheat and rye in the late 18th century. Scotch whisky is divided into five distinct categories: single malt Scotch whisky, single grain Scotch whisky, blended malt Scotch whisky (formerly called "vatted malt" or "pure malt"), blended grain Scotch whisky, and blended Scotch whisky.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll Scotch whisky must be aged in oak barrels for at least three years. Any age statement on a bottle of Scotch whisky, expressed in numerical form, must reflect the age of the youngest whisky used to produce that product. A whisky with an age statement is known as guaranteed-age whisky. A whisky without an age statement is known as a no age statement (NAS) whisky, the only guarantee being that all whisky contained in that bottle is at least three years old. The minimum bottling strength according to the regulation is 40% alcohol by volume.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe first known written mention of Scotch whisky is in the Exchequer Rolls of Scotland, 1494. [6] Scotch whisky was known as <i>aqua vitae</i>, Latin for "water of life."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMany Scotch whisky drinkers refer to a unit for drinking as a dram.\r\n</p>	40
53	Dubonnet	<p>\r\nDubonnet (UK: /djuːˈbɒneɪ/, US: /ˌdjuːbəˈneɪ/, French: [dybɔnɛ]) is a sweet, aromatised wine-based aperitif. It is a blend of fortified wine, herbs, and spices (including a small amount of quinine), with fermentation being stopped by the addition of alcohol. It is currently produced in France by Pernod Ricard, and in the United States by Heaven Hill Distilleries of Bardstown, Kentucky. The French made version is 14.8% alcohol by volume and the US version 19%. The beverage is famous in the UK for having been the favourite drink of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nDubonnet was first sold in 1846 by Joseph Dubonnet, in response to a competition run by the French Government to find a way of persuading French Foreign Legionnaires in North Africa to drink quinine. Quinine combats malaria but is very bitter.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOwnership was taken over by Pernod Ricard in 1976. It was re-popularised in late-1970s by an advertising campaign starring Pia Zadora. It is available in Rouge, Blanc and Gold (vanilla and orange) varieties. Dubonnet is also widely known by the advertisement slogan of the French graphic designer Cassandre "Dubo, Dubon, Dubonnet" (a play on words roughly meaning "It's nice; it's good; it's Dubonnet"), which still can be found on the walls of houses in France. The brand later became owned by Heaven Hill.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDubonnet is commonly mixed with lemonade or bitter lemon, and forms part of many cocktails.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nReputedly Dubonnet is a favourite beverage of:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, who liked gin and Dubonnet: 30% gin, 70% Dubonnet with a slice of lemon under the ice. She once noted before a trip, "I think that I will take two small bottles of Dubonnet and gin with me this morning, in case it is needed."</li>\r\n<li>Queen Elizabeth II, who likes two parts Dubonnet and one part gin with two cubes of ice and a lemon slice before lunch every day.</li>\r\n<li>Nelson Rockefeller, whose taste for alcohol was moderate, would have an occasional glass of Dubonnet on the rocks.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSources: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubonnet">[1]</a>.	14.8
54	Champagne	<p>\r\nChampagne (/ʃæmˈpeɪn/, French: [ʃɑ̃paɲ]) is a French sparkling wine. Many people use the term Champagne as a generic term for sparkling wine, but in the EU and some other countries, it is illegal to label any product Champagne unless it came from the Champagne wine region of France and is produced under the rules of the appellation. This alcoholic drink is produced from specific types of grapes grown in the Champagne region following rules that demand, among other things, specific vineyard practices, sourcing of grapes exclusively from designated places within the Champagne region, specific grape-pressing methods and secondary fermentation of the wine in the bottle to cause carbonation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe grapes Pinot noir, Pinot meunier, and Chardonnay are primarily used to produce almost all Champagne, but small amounts of Pinot blanc, Pinot gris, Arbane, and Petit Meslier are vinified as well. Only these specific grapes grown according to appellation rules on designated plots of land within the appellation may be used to make Champagne.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nChampagne became associated with royalty in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. The leading manufacturers made efforts to associate their Champagnes with nobility and royalty through advertising and packaging, which led to its popularity among the emerging middle class.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSource: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne">[1]</a>.	11
80	Powdered Sugar	<p>\r\nPowdered sugar, also called confectioners' sugar or icing sugar, is a finely ground sugar produced by milling granulated sugar into a powdered state. It usually contains a small amount of anti-caking agent to prevent clumping and improve flow. Although most often produced in a factory, powdered sugar can also be made by processing ordinary granulated sugar in a coffee grinder, or by crushing it by hand in a mortar and pestle.\r\n</p>	0

57	Plymouth Gin	<p>\r\nPlymouth Gin used to be Protected Geographical Indication that pertains to any gin distilled in Plymouth, England, but this stopped being true in February 2015. Today, there is only one brand, Plymouth, which is produced by the Black Friars Distillery. The Black Friars Distillery is the only remaining gin distillery in Plymouth, in what was once a Dominican Order monastery built in 1431, and opens onto what is now Southside Street. It has been in operation since 1793. The established distilling business of Fox & Williamson began the distilling of the Plymouth brand in 1793. Soon, the business was to become known as Coates & Co., which it remained until March 2004. In 1996, the brand was sold by Allied-Lyons to a management group headed by Charles Rolls who reinvigorated it. After turning the company around, they sold it in 2005 to the Swedish company V&S Group, who also made Absolut Vodka. The brand is now owned and distributed by the French company Pernod Ricard as a result of its purchase of V&S in 2008. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Recipe</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Plymouth Original Strength brand of gin is 41.2% ABV. It is different and slightly less dry than the much more common London style of gin, purportedly due to a higher than usual proportion of root ingredients, which bring a more 'earthy' feel to the gin as well as a softened juniper flavour. There is also a 'navy strength' variety which is 57% ABV (100° English proof), being the traditional strength demanded by the British Royal Navy. A 47% ABV (94 U.S. proof) version is distributed worldwide.\r\n</p>	41.2
62	Crème de Violette	<p>\r\nCrème de violette, also known as liqueur de violette, is a generic term for a liqueur with natural and/or artificial violet flower flavoring and coloring with either a brandy base, a neutral spirit base, or a combination of the two. The taste profile and aroma are distinctly floral and sweet, and to many reminiscent of the violet candies popular in the early to mid 20th century. Its known production dates back to the early 19th century when it was served with dry vermouth or alone as a cordial.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOne well-regarded brand is Benoit Serres Liqueur de Violette. However, it is reportedly very difficult to obtain even in France. Benoit Liqueur de Violette is made with a neutral spirit base with a smaller portion of Armagnac added to it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter crème de violette had been all but unavailable in the United States for decades, in mid-2007 Haus Alpenz began importing the Rothman & Winter Crème de Violette, which is made from Queen Charlotte and March violet flowers from the Alps. Since then, other brands of crème de violette have arrived on the US market, e.g., The Bitter Truth from Europe.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCrème de violette is the forerunner to the liqueurs Parfait d'Amour and the American variation, Creme Yvette, both of which are decidedly different with pronounced vanilla and/or citrus flavors. When crème de violette is not available it is possible to use the Parfait Amour or creme Yvette to replicate the violet color in a drink, though the taste profile is quite different.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe rarity of crème de violette appeared as a plot element in an episode of The Avengers in 1965 entitled "Two's A Crowd".\r\n</p>	20
65	Cider	<p>\r\nCider (/ˈsaɪdər/ SY-dər) is an alcoholic beverage made from the fermented juice of apples, although the legal definition for other fruit ciders can differ from country to country.\r\n</p>	4
66	Maple Syrup	<p>\r\nMaple syrup is a syrup usually made from the xylem sap of sugar maple, red maple, or black maple trees, although it can also be made from other maple species. In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.\r\n</p>	0
67	Rum	<p>\r\nRum is a distilled alcoholic drink made by fermenting then distilling sugarcane molasses or sugarcane juice. The distillate, a clear liquid, is usually aged in oak barrels. Most rums are produced in Caribbean and American countries, but also in other sugar producing countries, such as the Philippines and India.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRums are produced in various grades. Light rums are commonly used in cocktails, whereas "golden" and "dark" rums were typically consumed straight or neat, iced ("on the rocks"), or used for cooking, but are now commonly consumed with mixers. Premium rums are made to be consumed either straight or iced.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRum plays a part in the culture of most islands of the West Indies as well as The Maritime Provinces and Newfoundland, in Canada. The beverage has famous associations with the Royal Navy (where it was mixed with water or beer to make grog) and piracy (where it was consumed as bumbo). Rum has also served as a popular medium of economic exchange, used to help fund enterprises such as slavery (see Triangular trade), organized crime, and military insurgencies (e.g., the American Revolution and Australia's Rum Rebellion).\r\n</p>	40
70	Cognac	<p>\r\nCognac (/ˈkɒnjæk/ KON-yak, also US: /ˈkoʊn-, ˈkɔːn-/ KOHN-, KAWN-, French: [kɔɲak]) is a variety of brandy named after the commune of Cognac, France. It is produced in the surrounding wine-growing region in the departments of Charente and Charente-Maritime.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCognac production falls under French appellation d'origine contrôlée designation, with production methods and naming required to meet certain legal requirements. Among the specified grapes, Ugni blanc, known locally as Saint-Emilion, is most widely used. The brandy must be twice distilled in copper pot stills and aged at least two years in French oak barrels from Limousin or Tronçais. Cognac matures in the same way as whiskies and wines barrel age, and most cognacs spend considerably longer "on the wood" than the minimum legal requirement. \r\n</p>	40

72	Whisky	<p>\r\nWhisky or whiskey is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash. Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn, rye, and wheat. Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, generally made of charred white oak.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types. The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains, distillation, and aging in wooden barrels.\r\n</p>	40
73	Sherry	<p>\r\nSherry (Spanish: Jerez [xeˈɾeθ]) is a fortified wine made from white grapes that are grown near the city of Jerez de la Frontera in Andalusia, Spain. Sherry is produced in a variety of styles made primarily from the Palomino grape, ranging from light versions similar to white table wines, such as Manzanilla and fino, to darker and heavier versions that have been allowed to oxidise as they age in barrel, such as Amontillado and oloroso. Sweet dessert wines are also made from Pedro Ximénez or Moscatel grapes, and are sometimes blended with Palomino-based sherries.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nUnder the official name of Jerez-Xérès-Sherry, it is one of Spain's wine regions, a Denominación de Origen Protegida (DOP). The word sherry is an anglicisation of Xérès (Jerez). Sherry was previously known as sack, from the Spanish saca, meaning "extraction" from the solera. In Europe, "Sherry" has protected designation of origin status, and under Spanish law, all wine labelled as "Sherry" must legally come from the Sherry Triangle, an area in the province of Cádiz between Jerez de la Frontera, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa María. In 1933 the Jerez denominación de origen was the first Spanish denominación to be officially recognised in this way, officially named D.O. Jerez-Xeres-Sherry and sharing the same governing council as D.O. Manzanilla Sanlúcar de Barrameda.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter fermentation is complete, the base wines are fortified with grape spirit in order to increase their final alcohol content. Wines classified as suitable for aging as fino and Manzanilla are fortified until they reach a total alcohol content of 15.5 per cent by volume. As they age in a barrel, they develop a layer of flor—a yeast-like growth that helps protect the wine from excessive oxidation. Those wines that are classified to undergo aging as oloroso are fortified to reach an alcohol content of at least 17 per cent. They do not develop flor and so oxidise slightly as they age, giving them a darker colour. Because the fortification takes place after fermentation, most sherries are initially dry, with any sweetness being added later. In contrast, port wine is fortified halfway through its fermentation, which stops the process so that not all of the sugar is turned into alcohol.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWines from different years are aged and blended using a solera system before bottling, so that bottles of sherry will not usually carry a specific vintage year and can contain a small proportion of very old wine. Sherry is regarded by some wine writers as "underappreciated" and a "neglected wine treasure".\r\n</p>	15
40	Cherry Brandy	Cherry Brandy is a deep red cherry liqueur using fresh cherries from Eastern Europe.	20
88	Anisette	<p>\r\nAnisette, or Anis, is an anise-flavored liqueur that is consumed in most Mediterranean countries, mainly in Spain, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, Greece, Lebanon, Cyprus, Israel, Palestine and France. It is colorless, and because it contains sugar, is sweeter than dry anise flavoured spirits (e.g. absinthe). The most traditional style of anisette is that produced by means of distilling aniseed, and is differentiated from those produced by simple maceration by the inclusion of the word distilled on the label. And while Pastis is a similar-tasting liqueur that is prepared in similar fashion and sometimes confused with anisette, it employs a combination of both aniseed and licorice root extracts. Sambuca is essentially an anisette of Italian origin that requires a high minimum (350g/l) sugar content.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe liqueur is often mixed with water or poured over ice cubes because of its strong flavour.\r\n</p>	25
90	Orange Curaçao	<p>\r\nThe Orange Curaçao is a derivative of the Curaçao Triple Sec, but with orange coloring.

76	Pimento Dram	<p>\r\nPimento dram is an herbal liqueur with a rum base that is flavored with the distinct taste of allspice. Also called allspice dram, this is not a mixer that you'll find too often as you explore cocktail recipes. However, its dark spice is essential to many of the best tiki cocktails as well as cool-weather drinks. Adding a bottle to your bar is sure to elevate your drinking experience.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis liqueur goes by two names because of its main ingredient. Allspice is the berry of the pimento tree. The plant's fruit is also called Jamaican pepper and is the same pimento that is popularly stuffed into olives. The allspice berry is harvested and dried, making an appearance as a spice in Caribbean, Middle Eastern, and Latin American cuisines. In the drink world, allspice is often paired with other warming spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla in drinks like mulled wine.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAllspice dram originates in the tree's native Jamaica. According to Ted Haigh's "Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails," it was originally called pimiento in Spanish and became known as allspice when the English got ahold of it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe liqueur is made by soaking allspice berries in a rum base, which is then sweetened. Today, allspice dram is made in relatively the same manner. The flavor is best described as a combination of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. The amber-colored liqueur can be stored like other liqueurs (no need to refrigerate open bottles).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nAllspice dram became a relatively popular liqueur across Europe and in America. It was bottled commercially, most famously by the Jamaican rum company Wray & Nephew. Drinks from the early 1900s like the winter cocktail and the lion's tail (a 1930s mix of bourbon, allspice dram, lime, simple syrup, and aromatic bitters) showed off the unique taste of this sweet-spicy spirit.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDuring the mid-20th-century, allspice dram really found its place in the bar. This was due largely to its use by tiki bar pioneers like Trader Vic and Don the Beachcomber. Allspice dram was a natural complement and added a spicy background element to a number of rum cocktails. It began popping up in new renditions of cocktails like the Navy grog and planter's punch.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nUnfortunately, there was a time around the 1980s when pimento dram production ceased almost entirely. It was nearly impossible to find in the United States and many bartenders and drinkers attempted to make their own version. That has since changed. A renewed interest in reviving old cocktail recipes over the last few decades increased demand for such seemingly forgotten liqueurs. Eventually, a few companies released new bottlings of allspice dram.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSources: <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/profile-of-pimento-dram-760260">[1]</a>	22
77	Vodka	<p>\r\nVodka (Polish: wódka [ˈvutka], Russian: водка [ˈvotkə]) is a clear distilled alcoholic beverage with different varieties originating in Poland and Russia. It is composed primarily of water and ethanol, but sometimes with traces of impurities and flavorings. Traditionally it is made by distilling the liquid from potatoes or cereal grains that have been fermented, though some modern brands use fruits or sugar as the base.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSince the 1890s, standard vodkas have been 40% alcohol by volume (ABV) (80 U.S. proof). The European Union has established a minimum alcohol content of 37.5% for vodka. Vodka in the United States must have a minimum alcohol content of 40%.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVodka is traditionally drunk "neat" or "straight" (not mixed with water, ice, or other mixers), although it is often served freezer chilled in the vodka belt of Belarus, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Lithuania, Latvia, Norway, Poland, Russia, Sweden, and Ukraine. It is also used in cocktails and mixed drinks, such as the vodka martini, Cosmopolitan, vodka tonic, screwdriver, greyhound, Black or White Russian, Moscow mule, Bloody Mary, and Caesar.\r\n</p>	40
78	Caperitif	<p>\r\nCaperitif was a wine-based quinquina, similar to Lillet Blanc. It was manufactured in Cape Town, South Africa. The company that produced it is out of business.

82	Swedish Punsch	<p>\r\nPunsch (or punssi in Finnish) refers to a specific type of alcoholic liqueur and punch popular in Sweden and Finland. It is most frequently described as Swedish Punsch, and while historical variations have also been called Militär Punsch, Arrack Pun(s)ch, and Caloric Pun(s)ch, punsch should not to be confused with the term "punch" as used generically. It is made by the mixing of spirits (arrack, brandy or rum) with arrak tea (lemon & spices), sugar, and water, and was first brought to Sweden from Java in 1733. The spirit arrack is the base ingredient in most punsches, also imported into Europe by the Dutch from their colony in Batavia, Dutch East Indies. Punsch usually has 25% alcohol by volume (ABV) and 30% sugar.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhile still made in Sweden by combining ingredients, since the later part of the 19th century it is frequently purchased as a bottled liqueur under various brand names. It is drunk both warmed and chilled. \r\n</p>	25

85	Guinness Stout	<p>\r\nGuinness (/ˈɡɪnɪs/) is a dark Irish dry stout that originated in the brewery of Arthur Guinness at St. James's Gate, Dublin, Ireland, in 1759. It is one of the most successful alcohol brands worldwide, brewed in almost 50 countries, and available in over 120. Sales in 2011 amounted to 850 million litres (220,000,000 US gal). It is popular with the Irish, both in Ireland and abroad. In spite of declining consumption since 2001, it is still the best-selling alcoholic drink in Ireland where Guinness & Co. Brewery makes almost €2 billion worth of beer annually. \r\n</p>	5
86	Irish Whiskey	<p>\r\nIrish whiskey (Irish: Fuisce or uisce beatha) is whiskey made on the island of Ireland. The word 'whiskey' (or whisky) comes from the Irish (or 'Gaelic') <i>uisce beatha</i>, meaning <i>water of life</i>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIrish whiskey was once the most popular spirit in the world, though a long period of decline from the late 19th century onwards greatly damaged the industry. So much so that although Ireland boasted over 30 distilleries in the 1890s, a century later, this number had fallen to just three. Irish whiskey has seen a resurgence in popularity since the late twentieth century, and has been the fastest-growing spirit in the world every year since 1990. With exports growing by over 15% per annum, existing distilleries have been expanded and a number of new distilleries constructed. As of June 2019, Ireland has twenty-five distilleries in operation, with a further twenty-four either planned or under development. However, many of these have not been operating long enough to have whiskey produced on-site sufficiently aged for sale, and only one of these was operating prior to 1975. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSource: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_whiskey">[1]</a>.	40
101	Crème de Cassis	<p>\r\nCrème de cassis (pronounced [kʁɛm də ka'sis]) (also known as Cassis liqueur) is a sweet, dark red liqueur made from blackcurrants that are crushed and soaked in alcohol, with sugar subsequently added. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSeveral cocktails are made with crème de cassis, including the very popular wine cocktail, kir.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt may also be served as an after-dinner liqueur or as a frappé. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nThe modern version of the beverage first appeared in 1841, when it displaced "ratafia de cassis", which had been produced in prior centuries.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhile crème de cassis is a specialty of Burgundy, it is also made in Anjou, England, Luxembourg, Alberta, Quebec and Tasmania.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe quality of crème de cassis depends upon the variety of fruit used, the content of the berries, and the production process. If it is labelled "Crème de Cassis de Dijon", one is guaranteed berries from the commune of Dijon.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2015, the new protected geographical indication (PGI) “Crème de Cassis de Bourgogne” was approved. Promoted by a syndicate of fruit producers and liqueurs companies from Burgundy, this "Crème de Cassis de Bourgogne" guarantees the Burgundian origin and the minimum quantity of berries used in its production, essentially the variety Noir de Bourgogne. \r\n</p>	20
102	White Port	A subcategory of Portuguese fortified vines named Port Wine.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhite port is made from white grapes, such as <i>Malvasia Fina</i>, <i>Donzelinho</i>, <i>Gouveio</i>, <i>Codega</i> and <i>Rabigato</i>, and can be made in a wide variety of styles, although until recently few shippers have produced anything other than a standard product. Ordinary white ports make an excellent basis for a cocktail while those of greater age are best served chilled on their own. Sweet white port and tonic water is a commonly consumed drink in the Porto region. There is a range of styles of white port, from dry to very sweet. Taylor's introduced Chip Dry, a new style of white apéritif Port, in 1934. Made from traditional white grape varieties, it is fermented for longer than usual to give it a crisp dry finish. Lagrima, meaning "Tears", is the name for the sweetest style of white Port. In addition to this type of wine, there is the White Port Colheita, which is obtained from a single harvest and ages in huge tanks acquiring a straw color, has mature and elegant aromas and flavours, featuring fruity and wooden notes, and the White Port with an indication of age, which is an elegant, full-bodied and rich Port, obtained from the blend of different wines with the same average age. When white ports are matured in wood for long periods, the color darkens, eventually reaching a point where it can be hard to discern (from appearance alone) whether the original wine was red or white.\r\n</p>	17
103	Amer Picon	<p>\r\nAmer Picon (or Picon Amer) is a bittersweet French aperitif with a unique orange flavor. It is made with orange peels, gentian root, and cinchona. Amer Picon made an appearance in the original recipes for many classic cocktails but is primarily enjoyed in France today. Drinkers outside of Europe, including in the U.S., have been unable to find it on liquor store shelves for decades. The good news is that even if you can't get a bottle of Amer Picon itself, viable substitutes are available.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Substitutions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAmer Picon was widely available when many of the first bartending books were written and that is why it appears in so many recipes from the time. Since it is now a challenge to find outside of France and Europe, this leaves aficionados who want to recreate those drinks looking for alternatives.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Golden Moon Distillery opened its doors in Golden, Colorado, with a focus on reviving old herbal liqueurs. Among their offerings is Golden Moon Amer dit Picon. According to head distiller Stephen Gould, it uses the original 1830s recipe of Amer Picon, with one exception. Golden Moon Amer dit Picon is bottled at 39 percent ABV (78 proof). It is available at a number of liquor stores, including online and those that specialize in craft spirits.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAttempts have been made at homemade reproductions of Amer Picon and the majority have failed. The one that has been tested and approved by classic cocktail experts was developed by Jamie Boudreau. It is noted as being the closest recreation of the original formula and even compared to well-guarded bottles that remain in private collections. The recipe is dubbed "Amer Boudreau."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere are a number of other substitutes available, though none comes as close in flavor to Amer Picon as either version from Golden Moon or Boudreau.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Amer Torani: This is an Amer Picon replica produced in the U.S. It is not a highly recommended substitute though it is decent, easy to find, and commonly used.</li>\r\n<li>Amaro CioCiaro: Produced in Italy, this is one of the best substitutes for Amer Picon.</li>\r\n<li>Ramazzotti Amaro: A suitable Italian substitute, it is also the base used for Boudreau's recipe.</li>\r\n<li>Amaro Montenegro: Compared to others, this is a very light amaro. Made in Italy, it lacks the orange component, which is central to Amer Picon. </li>\r\n<li>Amaro Nonino: A grappa-based amaro from Italy, this option has a light profile and a slight hint of bitter orange.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Fast Facts</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ingredients: Neutral alcohol, orange peel, gentian root, cinchona, sugar, caramel</li>\r\n<li>Proof: 42 </li>\r\n<li>ABV: 21%</li>\r\n<li>Calories in a shot: 99</li>\r\n<li>Origin: France</li>\r\n<li>Taste: Bittersweet, orange</li>\r\n<li>Serve: On the rocks, cocktails</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nSources: <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/amer-picon-description-and-recipes-760257">[1]</a>.	21
104	Ginger Ale	<p>\r\nGinger ale is a carbonated soft drink flavoured with ginger. It is consumed on its own or used as a mixer, often with spirit-based drinks. There are two main types of ginger ale. The golden style is credited to the Irish doctor Thomas Joseph Cantrell. The dry style (also called the pale style), a paler drink with a much milder ginger flavour, was created by Canadian John McLaughlin. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nThomas Joseph Cantrell, an Irish apothecary and surgeon, claimed to have invented ginger ale in Belfast, Northern Ireland in the 1850s, and marketed it with local beverage manufacturer Grattan and Company. Grattan embossed the slogan "The Original Makers of Ginger Ale" on its bottles. This was the older style golden ginger ale, dark coloured, generally sweet to taste, with a strong ginger spice flavour. Ginger ale is clear; ginger beer is often cloudy due to the residues of brewing, and has a stronger ginger taste.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDry ginger ale is recognized as a Canadian creation by John J. McLaughlin, a chemist and pharmacist. Having established a soda water bottling plant in 1890, McLaughlin began developing flavour extracts to add to the water in 1904. That year, he introduced "Pale Dry Ginger Ale", the bubbly libation that would be patented in 1907 as "Canada Dry Ginger Ale". An instant success, Canada Dry products were accepted by appointment to the Vice-Regal Household of the Governor General of Canada. The dry-style also became popular in the United States during the Prohibition era, when it was used as a mixer for alcoholic beverages. Dry ginger ale quickly surpassed golden ginger ale in popularity. Today, golden ginger ale is an uncommon, more regional drink exemplified by Vernors. By contrast, dry ginger ale is produced on a large scale internationally, and is a staple in supermarkets and bars, and on airlines.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSource: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_ale">[1]</a>.	0
106	Port	<p>\r\nPort wine (also known as vinho do Porto, Portuguese pronunciation: [ˌviɲuduˈpoɾtu], Porto, and usually simply port) is a Portuguese fortified wine produced with distilled grape spirits exclusively in the Douro Valley in the northern provinces of Portugal. It is typically a sweet, red wine, often served as a dessert wine, though it also comes in dry, semi-dry, and white varieties. Fortified wines in the style of port are also produced outside Portugal, including in Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, India, South Africa, Spain, and the United States. Under European Union Protected Designation of Origin guidelines, only the product from Portugal may be labelled as port or Porto. In the United States, wines labelled "port" may come from anywhere in the world, while the names "Oporto", "Porto", and "Vinho do Porto" have been recognized as foreign, non-generic names for port wines originating in Portugal.\r\n</p>	19
114	Chocolate	A solidified mixture of mainly cocoa powder, cocoa butter and sugar in bricks or in powder form.	0
107	Byrrh	<p>\r\nByrrh is an aromatised wine apéritif made of red wine, mistelle, and quinine. Created in 1866 and a trademark since 1873, it was popular as a French apéritif. With its marketing and reputation as a "hygienic drink", Byrrh sold well in the early 20th century. It was even exported, despite the similarity of its name to "beer", complicating sales in English- and German-language speaking regions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nBrothers Pallade and Simon Violet, itinerant drapers from Thuir (France), decided to take advantage of the wine fever in the region to develop an apéritif wine flavoured with cinchona. They mixed dry wines and mistelles and initially marketed the resulting product as a health drink or tonic. This was because the local apéritif producers were displeased about competition with their established brands. Rebranding the brothers' aperitif as a health drink got around this problem, and Byrrh was sold in pharmacies.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Second World War initiated the decline of Byrrh. Aided by tax benefits, natural sweet wines such as Banyuls, Muscat de Frontignan, and Rivesaltes superseded Byrrh, which went out of fashion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1977, the family business, divided by strife, was acquired by Pernod-Ricard. Pernod-Ricard still makes the drink at its facility in Thuir near Perpignan, part of which was designed by Gustave Eiffel.\r\n</p>	18
108	Old Tom Gin	<p>\r\nOld Tom Gin (or Tom Gin or Old Tom) is a gin recipe popular in 18th-century England. In modern times, it became rare but has experienced a resurgence in the "Craft Cocktail" movement. It is slightly sweeter than London Dry, but slightly drier than the Dutch Jenever, thus is sometimes called "the missing link".\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe name Old Tom Gin purportedly came from wooden plaques shaped like a black cat (an "Old Tom") mounted on the outside wall of some pubs above a public walkway in 18th-century England. Owing to the Gin Craze, the British government tried to stem the flow of gin with prohibitive taxes and licensing, which drove the scene underground. Under the cat's paw sign were a slot to put money in and a lead tube. From the tube would come a shot of gin, poured by the bartender inside the pub.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOld Tom Gin was formerly made under licence by a variety of distillers around the world; however, one was recently relaunched by Hayman's distillery based on an original recipe. Since then a number of other companies have followed suit, such as: Booth's; Secret Treasures; The Liberty Distillery; Tanqueray; Langley's; Jensens; Ransom; Master of Malt; The Dorchester Hotel and The London Distillery Company Ltd.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAn Old Tom Gin made by J. Wray and Nephew Ltd. of Jamaica is also commonly found on the market.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOld Tom Gin is specified for Jerry Thomas' cocktail called the Martinez in his 1887 Bartender's Guide, How to Mix All Kinds of Plain and Fancy Drinks. The first record of it being used in the Tom Collins cocktail was the 1891 book, The Flowing Bowl: When and What to Drink.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSources: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Tom_gin">[1]</a>.	42
110	Orgeat Syrup	<p>\r\nOrgeat syrup is a sweet syrup made from almonds, sugar, and rose water or orange flower water. It was originally made with a barley-almond blend. It has a pronounced almond taste and is used to flavor many cocktails. Orgeat syrup is an important ingredient in the Mai Tai and many Tiki drinks.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe word "orgeat" (/ɔːrˈʒɑː, ˈɔːrdʒiət/) is derived from the Latin hordeaceus "made with barley" through the French, where barley is called orge. The Catalan word orxata, from which derives the Spanish horchata, has the same origin, though today the two drinks have little else in common and neither of them uses barley.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nAn early (but toxic) recipe for orgeat can be found in The English and Australian Cookery Book: "Take a pound and a quarter of bitter almonds, and half a pound of sweet almonds, which have been blanched, nine pounds of loaf sugar, six pints of water, and the rinds of three lemons. Pound the almonds in a mortar with the sugar, and add the water a little by degrees; then put the mixture on the fire with the lemon-peel. After a boil pour off the syrup and press the almonds, to extract the milk; add this to the syrup, and strain the whole through a sieve. When cold add a little orange flower water, and bottle the mixture. The orgeat is used as a summer drink, mixed with water, according to taste."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBitter almonds as a general rule contain cyanide and can be lethal in large quantities. Napoleon Bonaparte reputedly died in part from drinking too much orgeat that others had also concocted with additional poisons. For this reason modern syrups generally are produced only from sweet almonds. Such syrup products do not contain significant levels of hydrocyanic acid, so are generally considered safe for human consumption unless the person is allergic.\r\n</p>	0
115	Kola Tonic	<p>\r\nClaytons Kola Tonic is a very unique drink mix first sold in the 1880's. The heart of the drink is genuine West African Kola Nut extract, a well-known natural stimulant. Clayton's can be mixed with gin, rum, vodka, beer and stout, or lemonade, ginger ale, ginger beer, soda water or orange juice.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSource: <a href="https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/8977/claytons-kola-tonic">[1]</a>.	0
117	Lithia Water	Lithia water is defined as a type of mineral water characterized by the presence of lithium salts (as lithium carbonate or lithium chloride). Natural lithia mineral spring waters are rare, and there are few commercially bottled lithia water products.	0
118	Peppermint	Peppermint (Mentha × piperita, also known as Mentha balsamea Wild.) is a hybrid mint, a cross between watermint and spearmint. Indigenous to Europe and the Middle East, the plant is now widely spread and cultivated in many regions of the world. It is occasionally found in the wild with its parent species.	0
126	Jamaica Ginger	<p>\r\nFinally, we come to an ingredient that pretty much everyone agrees should remain defunct. Meant originally as an antispasmotic, Jamaica Ginger (also known as Ginger Jake) was sold in the United States as a patent medicine. But since it contained 70-80% alcohol by weight, it was also a popular way to circumvent Prohibition laws. The Treasury Department required that Jake be adulterated to make it unpalatable for drinking. Eventually, the adulterant was a plasticizer that also turned out to be a neurotoxin. By the end of Prohibition, Jake drinkers had started to lose control of their extremities, resulting in a shuffling gait that became known as Jake Walk. The affliction even inspired popular music, such as Asa Martin's "Jake Walk Papa". If for some odd reason, you want a ginger liqueur that won't paralyze you, try Domaine de Canton Ginger Liqueur.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSources: <a href="https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/09/guide-to-defunct-cocktail-ingredients-bitters-liqueurs-cordials-abbots-bokers-caperitif-out-of-production.html">[1]</a>.	75
139	Orange Gin	A gin with distinctly orange flavor and taste such as "Tanqueray Flor de Sevilla" or "Beefeater Blood Orange".	40
125	Fernet Branca	<p>\r\nFernet-Branca (Italian pronunciation: [ferˌnɛt ˈbraŋka]) is a brand of fernet, which is a style of amaro originating in Italy. Fernet-Branca was formulated in Milan in 1845, and is today one the best known of Italian bitters.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nFernet-Branca was formulated in Milan in 1845 by self-taught herbalist Bernardino Branca. It was marketed as a cure for cholera, stomach ache, and nervous disorders. The brand soon gained popularity, leading to the founding of the Fratelli Branca Distillery.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFratelli Branca invested in extensive advertising campaigns including the creation of calendars with artworks from famous artists in 1886. The eagle-and-globe logo was designed in 1893.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1907, Fratelli Branca began exporting their fernet to Argentina. Eventually the drink became so popular there that Fratelli Branca established a distillery in Buenos Aires.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe drink didn't attain significant popularity in the United States until after World War II. In 1960 production from the American distillery reached 60,000 cases.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Recipe</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nFernet-Branca has been produced according to the original recipe that has been handed down from generation to generation. The bitters are made from 27 herbs and other ingredients. The exact formula is a trade secret known only to the Fernet-Branca president, Niccolò Branca, who personally measures out the aromatics during the production process. It is known that the beverage contains aloe ferox (bitter aloe), gentian (a bittering agent), chamomile, angelica, quinine, chinese rhubarb, myrrh, peppermint, saffron.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFernet-Branca has a higher ABV—39%—and lower sugar content than most other amari. Fernet-Branca is one of the few amari to be aged in a barrel for a full year.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe manufacturer also offers a sweeter, mint-flavored liqueur, Branca Menta. \r\n</p>	39
124	Crème de Noyaux	<p>\r\nCrème de Noyaux (pronounced [kʁɛm də nwajo]) is an almond-flavored crème liqueur, although it is actually made from apricot kernels or the kernels of peach or cherry pits, which provide an almond-like flavor. Both Bols and Hiram Walker produce artificially colored red versions of the liqueur (either of which contribute the pink hue to Pink Squirrel cocktails) while Noyau de Poissy from France is available in both clear (blanc) and barrel-aged amber (ambre) versions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHistorically, crème de noyaux would contain trace amounts of hydrogen cyanide, which is poisonous. Although the chemical was not normally present in a dangerous intensity, bottles of 19th-century Noyaux left for decades in the cellar would sometimes have all the cyanide float up to the top, with lethal results for the drinker of the first glass. Dorothy Sayers used this peculiarity of the old Crème de Noyaux in her short story "Bitter Almonds" (collected in In the Teeth of the Evidence, 1939).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe name comes from the French noyau: "kernel, pit, or core". It is an ingredient in the Fairbank cocktail, the Pink Squirrel cocktail and in a cocktail called Old Etonian.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2013, Tempus Fugit Spirits recreated a 19th-century-style Crème de Noyaux — distilling both apricot and cherry pits, amongst other botanicals, and coloring the liqueur with red cochineal, as was done in the past. Care was taken to remove the trace elements of hydrogen cyanide produced in the process. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSources: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A8me_de_Noyaux">[1]</a>.	20
123	Sloe Gin	<p>\r\nSloe gin is a British red liqueur made with gin and sloes. Sloes are the fruit (drupe) of Prunus spinosa , a relative of the plum. Sloe gin has an alcohol content between 15 and 30 percent by volume. However, the European Union has established a minimum of 25% ABV for sloe gin to be named as such. Sloe gin is technically a gin-based liqueur, but due to historical prevalence at the time of writing the EU spirit drink regulations the colloquial name 'sloe gin' was included in the legal definitions and as such is the only gin-based liqueur that can legally be called gin without the liqueur suffix. The traditional way of making sloe gin is to soak the sloes in gin. Sugar is required to ensure the sloe juice is extracted from the fruit.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMany commercial sloe gins today are made by flavouring less expensive neutral grain spirits, although some manufacturers still use the traditional method. U.S. distilleries often use close relatives of the sloe, such as the Aronia berry or beach plum, to produce a domestic version of sloe gin.\r\n</p>	30
140	Parfait d'Amour	<p>\r\nParfait d'Amour (pronounced [paʁfe d‿amuːʁ]) or Parfait Amour is a liqueur. It is often used in cocktails primarily for its purple colour, and is generally created from a Curaçao liqueur base.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere are several versions of Parfait d'Amour. The House of Lucas Bols in the Netherlands claims to have originated the liqueur. Theirs appears to be a curaçao base, flavoured with rose petals, vanilla and almonds. Marie Brizard, a Bordeaux-based distiller, has a product with a similar flavor profile. Another form, produced by DeKuyper, uses a spirit as its base, and is flavoured with lemon, coriander and violets.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGuardian writer John Wright describes it as "a potent compound... It tasted like the perfume counter at Boots." He suggests a homemade version containing rose petals in a base of white rum or eau de vie, with the addition of syrups made from raspberry juice and rosehips.\r\n</p>	26
141	Beer	<p>\r\nBeer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drinks in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea. Beer is brewed from cereal grains—most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent. Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSources: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer">[1]</a>.	4.5
147	Blackberry Brandy	Brandy distilled from blackberry juice or brandy of different origin infused with blackberry juice or flavor.	35
133	Orange Flower Water	<p>\r\nOrange flower water, or orange blossom water, is the clear, perfumed by-product of the distillation of fresh bitter-orange blossoms for their essential oil.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis essential water has traditionally been used as an aromatizer in many Mediterranean traditional dessert dishes, such as in France for the gibassier and pompe à l'huile or in Spain for the Roscón de Reyes (King cake), or the Samsa in Tunisia or in Moroccan coffee, but has more recently found its way into other cuisines. For example, orange flower water is used in Europe to flavor madeleines, in Mexico to flavor little wedding cakes and Pan de muerto, and in the United States to make orange blossom scones and marshmallows. Orange flower water is also used as an ingredient in some cocktails, such as the Ramos Gin Fizz. In Malta and many North African as well as Middle Eastern countries, orange blossom water is widely used as medicine for stomach ache and given to small children as well as adults.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOrange flower water has been a traditional ingredient used often in North African as well as in Middle Eastern cooking. In Arab variants of baklava, orange blossom water is often mixed with the sweet syrup for flavor. Orange blossoms are believed to be used in this manner because they are seen as the traditional bridal flower and, therefore, symbolize purity (white, small and delicate). It is also added to plain water in the Middle East to mask high mineral content and other unpleasant flavors (e.g. those arising from storage in a <i>qulla</i>, a type of clay jug that keeps water cool in a manner similar to the zeer); some add the fragrance irrespective of the taste of the plain water.\r\n</p>	0
144	Clove Syrup	<p>\r\nA mixture of sugar and water infused with cloves and cooked.\r\nExample recipe:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>1 cup unrefined sugar</li>\r\n<li>1 cup water</li>\r\n<li>⅓ cup whole cloves</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn a small saucepan over medium heat, combine all the ingredients and bring close to a boil, stirring constantly, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Let cool at room temperature and strain into a clean bottle. Cover and keep refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.\r\n</p>	0
121	Clove	<p>\r\nCloves are the aromatic flower buds of a tree in the family Myrtaceae, Syzygium aromaticum. They are native to the Maluku Islands (or Moluccas) in Indonesia, and are commonly used as a spice. Cloves are available throughout the year due to different harvest seasons in different countries.\r\n</p>	0
155	Ice Cream	<p>\r\nIce cream (derived from earlier iced cream or cream ice) is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It may be made from dairy milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and any spice, such as cocoa or vanilla. Colourings are usually added, in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is stirred to incorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe meaning of the name "ice cream" varies from one country to another. Terms such as "frozen custard," "frozen yogurt," "sorbet," "gelato," and others are used to distinguish different varieties and styles. In some countries, such as the United States, "ice cream" applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients, notably the amount of cream. Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are sometimes labelled "frozen dairy dessert" instead. In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, one word is used for all variants. Analogues made from dairy alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes (e.g., soy, cashew, coconut, almond milk or tofu), are available for those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIce cream may be served in dishes, for eating with a spoon, or licked from edible cones. Ice cream may be served with other desserts, such as apple pie, or as an ingredient in ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, ice cream cakes and even baked items, such as Baked Alaska.\r\n</p>	0
158	Forbidden Fruit Liqueur	<p>\r\nForbidden Fruit was a 32-40% ABV grapefruit liqueur first created in the late 1800's and manufactured by Charles Jacquin et Cie. It was significant in pre-Prohibition cocktail recipes and continued being used frequently after the repeal of Prohibition in the United States. It ceased production in the late 1970's as its classic spherical bottle design was used for the then new Chambord.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nOriginally referred to as "the forbidden fruit" upon its first description by Reverend Griffith Hughes in 1750, the grapefruit was still considered a novel citrus in the United States through much of the 19th century. The grapefruit was originally imported to Florida by Count Odet Philippe in 1823, and only began to be shipped up the east coast to New York and Philadelphia in 1885. This made the introduction of Forbidden Fruit liqueur in the 1890's a very innovative move.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nForbidden Fruit was created by Louis Bustanoby of the well-known Café des Beaux-Arts. Prior to the commercial release of the liqueur, Bustanoby would make the liqueur as an individual drink utilizing the skin of a grapefruit, sugar, and fired brandy. Though it is not entirely clear what made up the commercially available liqueur, it is generally accepted that it was composed of grapefruit or pomelo, grape brandy, and honey. The final incarnation of the liqueur had a different formula based on apple-flavored syrup, and was not sold in the iconic spherical bottle.\r\n</p>	36
