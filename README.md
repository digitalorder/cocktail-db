Cocktail DB
===========

This is a dump of a relational DB I designed and filled to ease surfing around different cocktail recipe books. Yes, this is painstackingly filled **by hand** from existing sources (only one source at the moment, actually). But it already saved me long hours  looking through a physical copy of a book for a cocktail for tonight.

Note
----

All cocktails here comes from their respective owners. I do not claim any rights on them nor try to infringe existing copyright.

Does such thing even exist as cocktail ownership?

Note 2
------

This DB exists soleily for educational purposes. Drink moderately.
